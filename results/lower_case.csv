10,chapter i madame schmid round and red with the spotless lappets of her washerwomans cap flapping angrily was plainly in rage and the three loud whacks she gave at the garret door of 17 rue montignal caused two young gentlemen on the other side of the door to quake visibly
11,one of them fontaine ran incontinently into closet and hid while marsac the other after ghastly pretence of joke about madame schmids whacks sounding like the three given at the comdie franaise before the curtain goes up stalkedpg 2 with dignity to corridor door
12,but madame schmid bouncing in suddenly marsac as suddenly whisked out of sight
13,madame schmid was of that coarse buxom beauty common enough in her class
14,she had one year been elected queen of the washerwomen in that picturesque festival peculiar to paris and it had been said that fear of her stout arm and robust tongue had some share in her election
15,but she had good heart along with her vile temper and as she planted her basket viciously on the floor and whipped out tremendously long bill her quick eye took in the poverty of the surroundings and she was softened in spite of herself
16,however as one whistles going through graveyard so madamepg 3 schmid always stormed the more when her excellent heart prevented her from taking stronger measures
17,the room was excessively shabby
18,a motheaten sofa and large but rickety covered with newspapers and the implements of the journalists trade were the principal articles of furniture
19,the light of gray day shone dully in at the curtainless windows
20,a number of pipes together with cracked mirror ornamented the mantel while scattered about the room were violin and case an easel and painting materials
21,madame schmid belonged to that large class of persons who believe that man who engages in any form of art is necessarily loafer
22,the sight of the painters tools the violin and especially the abundance of pens ink and paper acted on her like red rag on bull and gave her the excuse she wanted to raise tempest
23,first she exclaimed scornfully pg 4 painters next more scornfully still fiddlers and last with concentration of contempt that would have made her fortune at any theatre in paris journalists then she began to bawl in voice like an auctioneer msieu marsac
24,msieu fontaine
25,oh i know you are somewhere about
26,this is an old dodge running away when i come with my bill
27,you owe me both of you for seven weeks washing
28,seven weeks have i rubbed and scrubbed for you and i have not seen the colour of my money yet madame schmid stopped for moment to take breath and then noticing the door leading into the corridor darted to it and began to tug vigorously at the knob
29,but marsac who was holding it on the other side was madame schmids superior in muscle though not in weight and the doorpg 5 resisted successfully
30,she then marched over to the closet door but fontaine followed marsacs tactics and madame schmid grew still redder in the face and shorter of breath with no better luck than at the corridor door
31,at that moment very welldressed little man entered the room after an almost imperceptible knock and unrolling bill about yard long began gentlemen i have little bill here and then raising his eyes he said in surprised voice why there arent any gentlemen here not if gentlemen pay their bills monsieur landais answered madame schmid sarcastically who recognised an old acquaintance in monsieur landais
32,madame schmid had had good obedient alsatian husband whom she had talked to death some years before andpg 6 landais and the late lamented schmid were from the same town
33,landais silently held out his bill and madame schmid flourished hers in his face with an air as if landais owed the money instead of marsac and fontaine
34,journalists are bad lot i can tell you rapidly began madame schmid who liked to have the first as well as the last word and lazy lot too
35,while you and i work for our living with our arms and our legs monsieur marsac and that pretty boy fontaine do nothing but sit in an easychair and write all day long
36,and they call that work i only wish i could sit in an easychair and amuse myself with pen all day instead of toiling over cuttingboard answered the tailor ruefully
37,painting and fiddling when they are not scribblingno wonder they cant pay their washbills
38,i dare say they think washing is an elegant amusement 7 im sure i dont know how ill ever get my money
39,writing them letters is sinful waste of paper and ink and calling to see them is sinful waste of time
40,that marsac always makes me laugh in spite of myself
41,the last time i saw him i put on very determined air here little landais assumed fierce look and asked him why my bill had not been paid
42,he told me that he and monsieur fontaine threw all their bills into basket and every six months they drew one out at random and paid that billand it so happened they had never drawn my bill
43,it was wretched joke but it made me laugh and i assure you the first thing i knew i was asking the fellow if he and his chum wanted anything in the tailoring line and he chucks me under the chin and tells me im so young and handsome ill be getting marriedpg 8 again and then like you i turn fool and laugh and pouf
44,goes my bill moaned madame schmid wagging her dolefully while landais shook his like chinese mandarin
45,then said landais wearily what are we climbing up all these stairs for god knows answered madame schmid
46,but i have no more time to waste on them so ill leave my bill and go so will i said landais and they laid their bills on the rickety and went out madame schmid clacking angrily all the way downstairs
47,the minute they disappeared fontaine slipped out of his closet and locked the door after them
48,he was handsome fairhaired fellow of fiveandtwenty with the most winning air in the world but it was plain at the first glance that with all his grace and intelligence he was man to be led by his affections
49,pg 9 i wish there was drawbridge outside this door he muttered and then began to rummage about the room
50,i wonder where marsacs purse is he continued to himself
51,ah here it isand only two francs five centimes in it and the shoemaker wants three francs for halfsoling marsacs shoes and then he began to call for marsac meanwhile going through the empty form of searching through his own pockets
52,in moment marsac entered the room
53,it was easy enough to see who was the master mind there
54,marsac was not so regularly handsome as fontaine but his dark bright eyes and captivating smile seemed to radiate brilliance all round him
55,after the first moment of seeing these two young men together it was not necessary to explain their relationspg 10 to each other
56,fontaine could not look at marsac without an almost feminine expression of fondness and tender reliance coming into his eyes and at the bottom of his heart he thought marsac the most brilliant capable and lovable of men
57,marsac on his part could not look or speak to fontaine without showing the affection of an elder for younger brother
58,they had been schoolmates ten years before at provincial college
59,from the first moment of their meeting they loved each other
60,fontaine was of the best blood of the province but he had neither father nor mother nor brother nor sister nor any near relative living
61,his was one of those hearts which must love something and he could not help loving marsac tall lithe boy older than he and quite able to fight fontaines battles as well as his own
62,marsac like fontaine was fatherless and motherless
63,he was educated frompg 11 fund for the sons of poor gentlemen which the recipient was expected to return when he was able
64,after taking all the honours in his classes and being graduated with the highest distinction marsac went to paris along with fontaine both to seek their fortunes in journalism
65,they soon got work but they made precious little money
66,marsac inspired with but one idea sent every franc he made back to the fund and repaid the sum advanced in an astonishingly short time
67,but it was at the cost of getting into debt on all sides
68,neither he nor his chum had that commercial knack that intimate knowledge of the purchasing power of franc which comes naturally to young men whose lives have been spent in large city
69,marsac was of buoyant temper and constantly expected something to turn up which would relieve them of all their embarrassments
70,meanwhile confident of the honesty of his intentions he met his debts dunspg 12 and difficulties with an incomparable archness and goodhumour
71,when fontaine asked him for franc for the shoes his reply was a franc
72,do you think i have complete counterfeiting apparatus that i can produce such sum as franc at moments notice then said fontaine ruefully who would willingly have given his only pair of shoes to marsac would he accept them i dont know what i am to do
73,the shoemaker said three francs or no shoes and i have only two francs five centimes
74,you have already spent enough on them to have bought new pairnew vamps in december new uppers in january and now in february new soles go along with you cried marsac
75,tell the shoemaker i have bad case of confluent smallpox and i dare say he will be glad to let you have the shoes for nothing
76,but give me that pastepot
77,our friends madamepg 13 schmid and monsieur landais have left us souvenirs which i can put to use and he began deftly cutting the bills which were on stout paper into square pieces to mend the screen with which like everything else in the room had holes in it
78,i am afraid the smallpox story wont be judicious subterfuge was fontaines reply
79,what did you do with the eleven francs we had yesterday i bought four bottles of wine box of cigars and two loaves of bread with it why were you so extravagant about bread asked marsac very cheerfully working away at the old screen
80,if you squander our substance on luxuries like bread we shant have anything left for necessaries like wine and cigars
81,the fact is he continued when man enters journalism he ought to have an education suitable to the profession
82,instead ofpg 14 going to the university i should have been taught the shoemaking and tailoring trades
83,how often have i heard that no learning comes amiss in journalism
84,now if i had the most rudimentary knowledge of cobbling i could have mended those shoes myself at all events said fontaine brushing his hat i am rather glad to be out of the way now for this is the very day and hour that madame fleury always appears to ask for the rent there cried marsac for the first time showing impatience i have been trying for two weeks to forget what day the rent is due and had just succeeded when you reminded me of it
85,i would rather see joan of arc coming at me full tilt on horseback or charlotte corday with her dagger than madame fleury with her bill i have heard it said that it is possible to live comfortably on large capital of debts but we have not foundpg 15 it so said fontaine still brushing his hat which however not all the brushing in the world could benefit
86,but the debts must be on respectable scale answered marsac something like seventy or eighty thousand francs
87,i dont believe though that everything we owe would mount up to ten thousand francs
88,i felt so humiliated the other day when one of the young fellows on the staff mere reporter while i am an editorial writerboasted of owing his tailor alone as much as we owe altogether
89,i could not help translating hundreds into thousands and said i owed my tailor nearly seven thousand francs when it is not quite seven hundred
90,but i saw that the youngster respected me more from that moment and maurepas the editorinchief asked me to breakfast the very next day
91,i was obliged to decline on account of these infernal shoes but i said it was because i was sent for by the minister of public instruction pg 16 marsac said fontaine after pause how can you be so cheerful in the midst of our difficulties have you not heard my little man that the laughing philosopher attained the goal of all wisdom while the weeping philosopher stood whimpering at the startingpost
92,does long face pay bill
93,or sour temper
94,depend upon it fortune looks for the smiling faces and so i try to keep mine ready to welcome her fontaine went out then and marsac having finished the screen took off his coat and with needle and thread began sewing awkwardly on it whistling like bird meanwhile
95,in the midst of it came knock at the doornot whack like madame schmids nor tap like landaiss but knock delicate yet firm polite but peremptory
96,marsac turned pale
97,nevertheless he hustled on his coat and opened the door with his best airwhich was very fine airpg 17 indeedand his landlady madame fleury entered
98,madame fleury was handsome woman of about fiveandthirty with fine dark eyes and carriage full of grace and dignity and moreover she exhibited selfpoise and selfpossession which prime minister might have envied
99,she was very simply dressed as became the morning but the simplicity was of the kind that costs
100,marsac courteously placed chair for her
101,i am glad to find you at home monsieur marsac were madame fleurys first words after the politest greetings had been exchanged
102,i had not seen you go in or out for day or two and thought perhaps you were ill a trifle mere trifle answered marsac with much readiness  littlepg 18 dinner at ministerial housethose fellows give one such lots of champagneand i inherit gout and it gave me touch so pray excuse my slippers
103,as soon as fontaine returns i shall put on my shoes and go for little walk then seeing madame fleurys handsome face assume its business expression he hastened to add how wonderfully well you are looking
104,you are blooming like rose thank you answered madame fleury calmly
105,in house like this there are certain lodgers whom i am compelled to call on occasionally in the way of business do you know madame continued marsac who had not ceased to examine madame fleurys features as if she were beautiful portrait or statue which he had never set eyes on before there is picture in the salon this year that might be taken for you
106,it is called springtime pg 19 young girl standing under an almondtree in bloom
107,the girls faceso fresh so lovelyis simply yours madame fleurys discouraging reply to this was business is business monsieur marsac and must be attended to marsac kept on as if he had not heard word
108,i cant for the life of me recall the artists name but i remarked aloud madame fleury must have sat for this charming face and very distinguishedlooking man who stood next me said in english then i would give thousand pounds to know madame fleury i wish you had accepted his offer responded madame fleury in tone that would have disconcerted talleyrand for never in my life would thousand pounds or even thousand francs be more acceptable marsac however not at all abashed exclaimed enthusiastically then all you have to do is to offer to pose for pg 20 nymph or goddess
109,bouguereau and all those highpriced fellows will simply be tumbling over one another in their eagerness to paint you monsieur marsac said madame fleury in tone of velvet softness which marsac perfectly understood and shuddered to hear i am talking business and i am talking art replied poor marsac
110,if you will kindly recall the date continued madame fleury
111,marsac taking up an almanac began turning the leaves
112,this is the 20th of february he mused
113,let me seewhat happened on the 20th of february
114,ah i have it
115,it is your twentyfifth birthday and you have come to receive our felicitations nonsense monsieur marsac replied madame fleury with the same tone of deadly sweetness
116,it is the day your rent is due and i have come to see if you are prepared to pay it andpg 21 also the arrears of two months you still owe marsac merely shook his  and for several minutes there was unbroken silence in the room each meanwhile closely attentive to the other
117,at last madame fleury spoke
118,it seems to me that two young men with your talents and characterfor i have found you both to have good characters except for this rent businessand of good families should be able to make better living out of journalism than you do ah madame answered marsac sorrowfully modern journalism has but one essentialit requires man to be an accomplished ready and felicitous liar and neither of us is that then why dont youahemtry to acquire that one essential transcendent liars madame fleury like poets are born not made
119,and then there is great deal in being notorious
120,fontaine and i have donepg 22 everything short of felony to bring ourselves before the public but we have failed
121,we have tried to drown ourselves in the seinewith lifepreservers on of course but the police found the lifepreservers on us and instead of making us favourably known humphwe were glad enough to hush up the affair
122,we have brought the most horrible charges against each other in print but nobody appeared at all surprised at them and the public by its indifference seemed to take it for granted that the worst was true
123,the only newspaper which took the trouble to investigate it sent reporter here and as illluck would have it the fellow caught us waltzing in each others arms for joy because we had just got dinner invitationand we had not had anything that could be called dinner for three weeks
124,our circumstances are indeed desperate
125,yesterday we had some money and fontaine bought two loaves of bread
126,i reproached him forpg 23 his extravagance in buying so much bread with these words marsac managed to cover dexterously box of cigars on the which madame fleury had not noticed
127,that is indeed poverty said madame fleury with some feeling and marsac seeing she was little touched continued eagerly we have tried everything
128,i sent play to manager and the only notice he has taken of it has been to write me that he didnt believe it would draw
129,of course it wont draw shut up in the managers box
130,i never expected it to draw until it was produced
131,i sent it under the name of fontaine as being more aristocratic than marsac
132,fontaine you know has graveyards full of noble ancestors while i like napoleon am the first of my family
133,then i sent picture called a rough sea to the salon also under the name of fontaine 24 one of the judges said the thing made the whole committee illit was so realistic i presumeand yet they rejected it madame fleurys eyes softened and with glint of widows smile upon her handsome mouth she said gently after moment have youhas either one of youever thought ofahemmarriage as way out of your troubles often answered marsac promptlythat is for fontaine
134,he was to be the victimthe iphigenia so to speak
135,as for myself there are two things i dreaddeath and marriage
136,i must die but i need not marry
137,i have sworn i will never be taken alive madame fleury blushed smiled and murmured more men marry than dont
138,most of them marry without qualm true answered marsac gravely and there are men who will pick uppg 25 poisonous snake and dangle it in the air
139,but i am not one of them
140,i have no taste for dangling poisonous snakes
141,i am afraid of them and how stands monsieur fontaine on this subject he is brave to rashness
142,i believe him fully capable of marrying
143,in fact fontaine seems to have penchantpg 26 for mademoiselle claire duval daughter of duval the rich old brewer there is niecemademoiselle delphine duvalwho has just gone to live with them said madame fleury who liked to show her knowledge of the acquaintances of the two young men
144,i had not heard of that
145,the truth is since we pawned our evening clothes we have not seen anything of the duvals
146,however as fontaine could not marry claire until he paid his debts and he could not pay his debts until he married claire the matter seems to have settled itself madame fleury assumed striking attitude in her chair and then began to speak with an insinuating softness in every word and glance and motion you have told me much about you and your friend now i will tell you something about myself and it may result ininan arrangement mutually advantageous her voice sank topg 27 mere whisper
147,as you know i am widow certainly replied marsac
148,i knew it the very first moment i saw you you had such cheerful air i have every reason to look cheerful
149,the late monsieur fleury was nothing but trouble to me from the hour i married him until the day the news was brought me that his had been found in the river gracious powers cried marsac in astonishment was not the late monsieur fleury an angel no answered madame fleury and i dont believe he is an angel now either strange strange murmured marsac
150,a departed husband not an angel
151,this is phenomenon
152,allow me to make note of it and taking out notebook he gravely made memorandum
153,a husband monsieur marsac is very like lobster salad
154,when it ispg 28 good it is very good and when it is bad it is intolerable
155,monsieur fleury was very bad
156,at last he sank so low that he became janitor in medical school
157,he was accused one day of stealing some valuable books and instruments and soon after his was found in the seine
158,it is supposed he committed suicide knowing himself to be guilty
159,i did not see the  and tried to avoid all associations with the affair but do what i could it became known that he had once been my husband
160,i find the name of man so unpleasantly notorious very inconvenient to bear and i should like to change it marsac after listening intently to this buried his ears in his hands and appeared to be thinking profoundly for some minutes
161,i should think madame he said after this pause of reflection that could be accomplished
162,the authorities on application will permit you to change your name something like contempt appeared inpg 29 madame fleurys dark eyes and she responded coldly i should also like the protection which the name of some respectable man would give me a pause longer and more awkward ensued
163,it seemed to marsac as if he actually felt the temperature in the room falling ten degrees every second
164,for once language failed him and he heard himself saying in quavering voice and almost without his own volition would that i were respectable man madame fleury turned her dark eyes on him and drew nearer
165,her breathing quickened and faint pink rose in her smooth cheek and she said in laughing voice which also trembled little you are quite respectable enough for me proposals of marriage are always embarrassing and none the less so when as the breton peasants say thepg 30 haystack chases the cow marsac felt himself suddenly grow hot and as suddenly grow cold
166,he sat quite near madame fleury her halflaughing and brightly burning eyes fixed on him
167,every detail of her elegant and correct morning costume her wellshod feet her handsome  was abnormally present to him
168,but he found it impossible to raise his eyes to her face
169,the only clear idea in his mind was frantic fury towards the women of the present day who he foresaw would make these bad quarters of an hour such as he was undergoing common enough to men in the future
170,as for madame fleury marsacs embarrassment was not lost on her and although new woman she was still woman and womanly pride impelled her to control the slight tremor of her nerves and say in voice studiedly cold it is mere matter of business and of convenience with me pg 31 this gave marsac as he thought loophole of escape and he said hurriedly i madame in my innocence have regarded marriage as matter of sentiment imagine his chagrin though when madame fleury smiling and blushing like girl replied well monsieur marsac if you will have it so marsac saw in moment the pit he had dug for himself but he preferred to play the part of poltroon to stepping into it
171,he turned and fidgeted in his chair he looked out of the window down at the street hoping to see fontaine returning and every moment the situation grew more appalling
172,presently he managed to say until he is forty man is too young to marry and after he is forty he is too old madame fleury surveyed him all over with cool contempt which seemed to leave blisters on his 
173,then brilliant idea came to him 32 he glanced at madame fleury and saw as well as felt the rage rising in her heart against him
174,he tried to speak calmly and naturally but his words were jerked out of him with stammering and stuttering you are very very gggood madame and i feel more pleasedno no i mean honouredthan i can explainexpress that is
175,but you know how fontaine and i have lived together since our boyhood
176,we have nobody but each other we have shared everything as brothers
177,now dddo you think it quite fair that i should like pig accept this dazzling offer without giving fontaine chance it was blunderingly enough spoken but it served
178,marsac saw in moment that madame fleury would much rather after that have killed him than married him and when she spoke her cold dignity made him feel like mouse under an exhausted airreceiver
179,pg 33 i dont know but that you are right after all and monsieur fontaine is really the superior man and consequently better suited to me the door at that moment flew wide open and fontaine rushed inhis coat mass of mud and rags and his trousers slit from the knee to the hip and he did not have marsacs shoes
180,without observing madame fleury who sat little to one side he burst out its no good marsac the shoemaker said three francs or no shoes then seeing madame fleury he stopped overwhelmed with embarrassment
181,not so the lady who quietly remarked to marsac this accounts for the story of the cabinet dinner and the gout and so on and she added with an air of the finest sarcasm i see no earthly reason why you monsieur marsac should not succeed brilliantly in journalism pg 34 marsac was quite disposed to let fontaine take his part of the situation then and said not word but fontaine exclaimed i know what you have come for madame fleury
182,it is the rent then you show very superior intelligence to monsieur marsac as i had the greatest difficulty in making him understand what i came for responded madame fleury
183,i am awfully sorry kept on fontaine but we havent sou except thisholding out two francsand i had an accident on the way and ruined my only coat and trousers and marsac has no shoes and i dont know what we shall do fontaine stopped half crying
184,i can suggest something said madame fleury showing an amazing calmness
185,not to go over the same ground twice i have determined to change my name and condition and here she paused for effectpg 35 and marsac came unexpectedly to her assistance
186,fontaine said he solemnly i have been true friend to you
187,as soon as madame fleury mentioned this i offered her your hand fontaine looked at marsac supposing either he himself or his friend had gone crazy but marsacs cool demeanour proved that he at least was sane
188,fontaine with his mouth open but dumb with astonishment gazed first at marsac and then at madame fleury
189,he is speechless with happiness cried marsac
190,i knew he would be delighted
191,you see marrying runs in fontaines family
192,his father and mother were married and his grandparents on both sides were married and even his greatgrandfathers and greatgrandmothers were married
193,isnt that so fontaine fontaine still dazed mumbled i dont know pg 36 fie you bad man replied marsac laughing
194,pray madame fleury dont believe that
195,i know what i am talking about and i assure you that all these people in fontaines family were married madame fleury then rose majestically
196,gentlemen this matter must be settled at once
197,you have your choice marriage or an eviction within twentyfour hours and all the arrears of rent paid fontaine who was gradually returning to his senses said but madame it is impossible
198,marsac has no shoes i have no clothes if you do not choose to accept my proposition monsieur fontaine coolly interrupted madame fleury you will be put into the street within twentyfour hours and when you reach the street you will be arrested for nonpayment of rent and if i go into the street without any coat or trousers i shall certainlypg 37 be arrested answered fontaine desperately
199,madame fleury shook her  as if the whole affair were nothing to her
200,marsac advancing to fontaine whispered in his ear promise her
201,promising isnt marrying you know
202,you promise her no you do it i cant
203,she wont have me
204,you do it
205,i have known several men whopg 38 have escaped with their lives from widows fontaine thus urged by marsac whom he had never resisted in his life looked helplessly from his friend to his landlady and from his landlady back to his friend
206,after all promising was not marrying and it was worth good deal to get her out of the room
207,madame fleury brought matters to crisis by asking smiling which shall it be gentlemenan engagement or an eviction fontaine could not bring himself to say the word but he submitted silently when marsac taking his hand led him to madame fleury and placing their hands together said with something dangerously near wink take the lovely hand held out to you
208,quaff the cup of happiness held to your lips
209,madame fleury you will exchange for your present name one of the most distinguished names among the great families of francewhichpg 39 was true enough as far as fontaines name was concerned
210,madame fleury whose principle it was to get through quickly with an awkward business asked marsac to sit down and write out little agreement to be signed by fontaine and herself
211,and it might be as well she added to name the date of the fulfilment of this promise
212,let me seethis is the 20th of february pg 40 she paused and reflected
213,marsac who had seated himself at the reflected too and then after moment he said the 31st of april there is no 31st of april replied madame fleury
214,the first of april would seem appropriate kept on marsac very gravely
215,dont trouble yourself to be sarcastic monsieur marsac replied madame fleury with cutting emphasis
216,it would do admirably if i were marrying you but otherwise not the twentyninth of february then this is not leap year oh i thought it was madame fleury did not condescend to notice this fling and marsac writing very slowly proceeded to draw up an informal agreement to marry between marie fleury and auguste fontaine
217,fontaine had dropped limp upon pg 41 chair and sat with his buried in his arms the picture of misery
218,but awkward and humiliating as it was he had not the smallest doubt that marsac whom he thought capable of meeting any emergency would eventually get him out of the scrape
219,when madame fleury had signed the paper marsac called fontaine who remained motionless without lifting his 
220,thats his way of showing he is pleased explained marsac in the most serious manner
221,i told you he would be delighted and i know at this moment he is revelling in rapture only he has rather singular manner of showing it he has indeed said madame fleury but i am vain enough to think that it is merely the suddenness of the affair which has somewhat disconcerted him fontaine almost dragged out of his chair by marsac sullenly signed thepg 42 paper and after taking possession of it and recommending him to act in good faith with her madame fleury departed with the air of person who has made successful stroke of business
222,as soon as she was gone fontaine with loud groan threw himself on the sofa
223,even marsac began to be somewhat frightened at the turn of affairs
224,he thought it not unlikely that the prospect of marrying handsome young man far above her in social position might be really in madame fleurys mind
225,but he would not mention his fears to fontaine and as soon as madame fleury was safely out of hearing marsac contrived to raise burst of rather hollow and hysterical laughter
226,to think she should imagine that she could trap us in any such way as that
227,ha
228,ha fontaines reply from the depths of the sofa was something between groan and howl and he moanedpg 43 you know marsac i love claire duval and this devilish madame fleury has my written promise a bagatelle cried marsac still keeping up the pretence of laughter
229,do you suppose i would have let you get into such trap if i could not have got you out this gave some comfort to fontaine who had sublime faith in marsacs powers as well as his friendship
230,but in spite of all his efforts marsac pretty soon had to give up the hilarious view of the situation
231,fontaine lay on the sofa groaning kicking and occasionally sighing out the name of claire duval
232,marsac looked out of the window at prospect made up chiefly of chimneypots and fine small rain that began to fall and for the first time realised their truly desperate situation
233,after half an hour of silence on his part and complainings on fontaines shadow of his old spirit came back to marsac
234,pg 44 if one of us only had rich relation we could murder
235,but i dont believe any two fellows in the world have so few near relations as we fontaine by this time was sitting up on the sofa his in his hands
236,presently he said with gloomy indifference i had an uncle an americanuncle mauricewho has not been in france for twentyfive years and the last we heard of him he was living on fifteen cents day in new york
237,then we heard in roundabout way that he was dead but he had nothing to leave anybody very likely sighed marsac
238,an american and his money are soon parted the next moment fontaine believed that the last and greatest of misfortunes had befallen his friend for marsac leaping up began to charge about the room shouting at the top of his lungs
239,hurrah
240,hurrah
241,your unclepg 45 maurice has died and has left you fortune
242,huzza
243,what glorious idea
244,huzza for uncle maurice fontaine stunned at first went up to marsac who was capering wildly about and in voice tremulous with apprehension and himself deadly pale said my dear kind marsac be quiet pray
245,you have taken our misfortunes too much to heart and they have unbalanced you
246,sit down awhile i have some moneythe poor lad had not sou but the two francsquite enough for several days it was piteous to see his weak pretences
247,he rattled the two francs in his pocket and tried to smile
248,marsac seeing the dreadful thought in fontaines mind stopped his whooping and seizing fontaine in his arms cried out you honest little simpleton
249,of course uncle maurice hasnt just died and left you fortune but let the world think so and see if our fortunespg 46 are not made
250,how would paragraph like this sound in the papers we are happy to announce that monsieur auguste fontaine the brilliant young journalist has inherited fortune oflet me see its as easy to give you two million francs as one millionfrom his lately deceased uncle monsieur maurice fontaine of new york the celebratedwineimporter i should say thats good decent business
251,i can work the paragraph up more tell about your uncle maurice going against the traditions of his family in entering trade and all that sort of thing
252,trust me to get it up fontaine was so delighted at finding marsac was not crazy after all that he could do nothing but hug him and say marsac i was so frightened when you began to talk so and you may kill all my uncles and aunts if you can find any to kill
253,but willwill this dazzling story be believed about uncle whatshisname pg 47 my dear fellow replied marsac in high goodhumour dont you know there is large of the human race that goes about actually begging to be humbugged
254,did you ever know wildly improbable story started yet that wasnt readily believed
255,and the more it is contradicted the more it is believed
256,at any rate it cant do us any harm nothing can harm us in our present straits well if people should believe in uncle maurice began fontaine anxiously but marsac cut him short
257,believe in uncle maurice
258,why i believe in him and i created him myselfthat is our uncle maurice
259,dear kind old chap
260,i feel as if i had just shaken hands with him but persisted fontaine if madame fleury should believe in him and the fortune wouldnt it be that much more difficult for me to escape from her we should be in that much betterpg 48 condition to fight her
261,no my boy dont refuse fortune of two million francs even on paper
262,why continued marsac producing from corner his palette brushes and an unfinished portrait of spanish bullfighter look
263,i will make you portrait of uncle maurice and with few bold strokes the bullfighter assumed the appearance of hale old gentleman of sixty in black coat and white tie
264,but there is no time to lose cried he throwing down his palette and brushes
265,it ought to be in the afternoon papers
266,there is the clock on the churchtower striking eleveni shall have time yet before they go to press
267,give me your shoes fontaine kicked them off and marsac put them on
268,and your hat is betterpg 49 than mine fontaine ran and fetched the hat
269,let me see the paragraph ought to be written out marsac seated himself at the and fontaine hung over him while he rapidly wrote half page and then rising and going out cried keep up your heart old boy
270,you are not married yet you are long way off from being monsieur fleury left alone fontaine remained silent and overwhelmed at the various and startling incidents which had befallen him that morning
271,how little one knows he thought what an hour may bring forth
272,it is now eleven oclock since ten oclock i have become engaged to be married i have found longlost uncle he has died and left me two million francs a slight sound caused him to raise his  and he saw letter pushed under the door
273,he ran forward and opened it and then literally fell overpg 50 on his chair with amazement and chagrin
274,the letter ran my dear nephew augustethe report which reached my family that i was dead was erroneous
275,i am very much alive and think of soon revisiting my native land
276,i have had hard struggle and i may not meet with very flattering reception from my family of whom you are my only really near relative but i feel quite able to take care of myself
277,i may appear at any moment and until we meet i am your affectionate uncle maurice fontaine
278,fontaine rallied enough to run to the window to call marsac back
279,but it was too late
280,marsac with the slip of white paper in his hand was just turning the corner
281,pg 51 chapter ii marsac returned within three hours to be confronted by fontaine with pale face and uncle maurices letter
282,for once marsac was staggered
283,the paragraph was already in print and the afternoon papers containing it were being cried on the street
284,he read the letter carefully then laid it down saying it is impossible that he should return
285,living on fifteen cents day for twenty years must have impaired his constitution to that degree that he cannot stand the voyage fontaine already in the depths of woe seemed to sink deeper and deeper
286,not so marsac whose cheerfulness never left him
287,all day the two friends sat in their garret unable on accountpg 52 of fontaines dilapidated clothes and marsacs want of shoes to go out and get anything to eatfor they could still go to restaurant near the newspaper office and get dinner on credit
288,they both shrank from admitting their necessities by asking for an advance from the business office of their newspaper
289,marsac spent the day in patching and cleaning with awkward industry fontaines torn coat and trousers
290,never had fontaine loved and admired him more
291,he sang and whistled all day long made jokes and pretended that doing without food and fire was rather an amusing experience
292,at nightfall he held up the torn and soiled coat and trousers for inspection
293,the poor fellow had done his best but they were clearly not presentable
294,not even then did his courage and spirits desert him
295,he laughed at his own failure and said gaily well my boy what tale this will make to tell when we get richpg 53 for half the pleasure of rich people consists in telling how happy they were when they had not second shirt to their backs at that moment servant in the establishment opened the door without ceremony and thrust in huge box with the name of charlevois tailor on it
296,scarcely was the door shut when the two young men tore open the box
297,there lay several suits of the handsomest mourning clothes imaginable with hats and gloves to match and on top of everything was pinned letter
298,it was from charlevois one of the best tailors in paris saying that he had taken the liberty of sending monsieur auguste fontaine several suits of clothes asking his inspection of them
299,he had read in the papers that evening of monsieur maurice fontaines death and wouldpg 54 be glad to supply monsieur auguste fontaines mourning
300,also that his son was in the stationery business and had enclosed some samples of stationery
301,the two young men gazed intently at each other
302,then without word fontaine with marsacs help put on an evening suit and then topcoat with crapecovered hat and black gloves
303,he certainly looked very handsome in his new outfit
304,it was almost the first time in his life that he had ever been really well dressed and the elegantly simple costume brought out his aristocratic beauty
305,marsac looked at him with the delight of mother over beautiful daughter dressed for her first ball
306,fontaine walked up and down surveying himself with satisfaction in the cracked mirror
307,he examined his old coat and trousersthey looked worse than ever by comparison
308,his silence said eloquently i cannot take these gentlemanly habiliments off 55 he put the hat on his 
309,with marsac he moved toward the door they paused
310,this is the rubicon said marsac
311,the rubicon is passed replied fontaine stepping out
312,they went to the restaurant where they had credit to dinner and were seen by twenty persons of their acquaintance
313,as they approached the desk on entering the cashier handsome girl was glancing at an afternoon paper containing the paragraph about uncle maurice
314,she recognised fontaine whom she had seen before
315,do you wish private room gentlemen she asked
316,certainly answered marsac solemnly who had not thought of it before
317,auguste you would rather not dine in public today fontaine shook his  and the two friends in silence fontaine with his eyes bent on the mourning hat he carried went into private diningroom 56 an obsequious waiter brought card
318,marsac ordered an excellent dinner with champagne
319,when it came the sight of it was almost too much for the poor halfstarved young fellows
320,it was the first time they had really dined in weeks
321,they made an excuse to send the waiter out of the room when they hugged each other and began to dance wildly and barely had time before he returned to scuttle back to their chairs and pull long faces while they devoured fish flesh and fowl entres horsdoeuvres and everything else eatable on the 
322,marsac in the waiters absence begged fontaine to spare the candelabra while fontaine caught marsac in the act of chewing the paper off the marrons glacs
323,pg 57 this said marsac while the waiter was out of the room for they kept him on the trot may be called our first dress rehearsal
324,we are to appear before the public tomorrowyou as the heir of your uncle maurice i as the friend of the nephew of his uncle do you think we have deceived the waiter anxiously asked fontaine
325,perfectly
326,he never saw us order such dinner before but i hope he will see us order good many more like it
327,look solemnhe is coming and the waiter coming in found marsac urging fontaine to eat who seemed to be in the depths of despondency
328,when the time came for feeing the man fontaine said sadly you marsac must pay tonight
329,i forgot i had changed my clothes certainly replied marsac clapping his hand to his pocket and producing the two francsthe last they had on earth which he had taken the precautionpg 58 to bring with himand handing them to the waiter
330,those two francs made everybody in the restaurant believe the story of fontaines fortune
331,after the dinner which lasted for three hours they went home and fontaine wrote note on the blackedged paper to the editor of their paper la lune asking for leave of absence for few days owing to the loss of near relative
332,marsac took it to the office
333,his fellowworkers crowded round him asking questions about the paragraph which had appeared that afternoon
334,marsac confirmed it but declared they had not got any particulars as to the amount of the fortune
335,but i should say it will be under three millions he added with entire accuracy
336,next day paris rang with the story
337,it cannot be denied that both marsac and fontaine were little frightened at the sudden and overpowering success of their little romance
338,they had notpg 59 counted upon the instant and enormous sensation it created
339,but there was now no retreat for them
340,being once committed to uncle maurice they had to abide by their own invention and it taxed even marsacs powers to meet the emergency
341,fontaine simply declared that he could not face the world in his new character and kept close to his lodgings to avoid interrogatories
342,naturally that did still more to set the story on its legs and when he began to receive letters of condolence mixed with congratulations and was forced to reply to them on paper with black border an inch deep and signed with inky sealingwax even he himself began to believe that his uncle maurice had died and left him fortune
343,marsac who was remarkably clever with his brush made an excellent picture of uncle maurice out of the transformed bullfighter and by dint of artistically smoking it the newness ofpg 60 the paint was taken off
344,he was however simply forced to invent biography of uncle maurice with names dates and events
345,the first time he was asked how uncle maurice made his money he was obliged to say how so he represented that it was all made in the wineimporting line
346,if i had had moment to think i should have said mining operations he said to fontaine afterward but taken unawares i hit upon the winebusiness
347,and then i had to explain that he went against the traditions of his family by engaging in trade but was immensely successful so they forgave him
348,and then i drew noble picture of uncle mauricefor look you fontaine as we have profited by the old gentleman the least we can do is to give him good character
349,i have adorned him with every virtue
350,if he could come to life i am sure he would be pleased with the reputation i have given him pg 61 but marsac he is alive
351,that is the maddening part
352,suppose the real uncle maurice should come walking in here some fine daywhat would you say i should say good morning monsieur fontaine delighted to see you
353,have cigar
354,we heard that you were dead and the old gentleman would be so pleased at finding himself alive that he would forgive us anything among the first persons to hear the story was madame fleury and the hardest task before marsac was when he was stopped by her in the entresol one morning with an inquiry whether the story was true or not about fontaines uncles death
355,alas
356,it is only too true replied marsac sorrowfully
357,i think monsieur auguste should have informed me of it said madame fleury considering our relations ah madame you widow canpg 62 have no idea of the bashfulness of young man like fontaine in his first love affair
358,the relations of men and women are so changed now
359,i am barely thirty but i remember when it was the lady who was diffident
360,but the last diffident woman i understand has been secured for the jardin des plantes madame fleury heard this with smile playing round her handsome mouth
361,i hardly think that the engagement between monsieur auguste fontaine and me can be called love affair
362,it was business arrangement pure and simple
363,however if this story about his uncle maurice and his fortune is true then i shall look forward with more satisfaction than ever to the 15th of may
364,but why does not monsieur fontaine call to see me occasionally bashfulness madame fleurypure bashfulness
365,i tell you men and women have changed places
366,i predictpg 63 that in few years young man will no more think of calling on his fiance than few years back his fiance would have called on him madame fleury heard this uttered in marsacs airiest manner with the same inscrutable smile
367,when marsac left her presence after an hours laboured explanations he had not the slightest certainty whether she believed in uncle maurice or not
368,he rather thought she did not from her last remarkwhich was that if monsieur fontaine really had inherited two million francs she would be glad to have the two hundred he owed her
369,however to have got two hundred francs from fontaine would have been like getting oysters out of strawberry bed
370,as the days went on he got great many things like the mourning clothes and blackedged paper and he was pursued by tradesmen desiring him to open accounts with them
371,but not franc had he
372,his absence from thepg 64 newspaper office cut off his small salary there and while dining at his favourite restaurant every day smoking the best cigars and enjoying other luxuries he often had not one sou to rattle against another
373,marsac kept up his courage though by telling him that something would soon turn up which would enable them to pay their debts escape from madame fleurys house and live like lords
374,and when that happy event was accomplished marsac promised that fontaine should be rid of madame fleury and in position to ask the hand of claire duval whom fontaine grew every day more passionately in love with although it had been months since he had seen her
375,whenever fontaines courage failed marsac always held out to him the hope of marrying claire
376,just let me catch old duvali dont like to go in search of himcried marsac and i will give him such an account of you that he willpg 65 be throwing his daughter at your 
377,and as she is sweet girl and i believe is really in love with you there will be marriage sure
378,the only thing on my conscience is that i am putting noose around your neck a noose
379,a garland you mean
380,ah could i live to have claire for my wife
381,but that infernal widow downstairs dont speak of your fiance in that disrespectful manner cried marsac at the same time dodging fontaines new hat which flew in his direction
382,pg 66 one night about six weeks after uncle maurices advent fontaine was in their garret waiting for marsac to return
383,the room was as shabby as ever but fontaine was dressed in the height of the  although still in the deepest mourning
384,his bright face as he walked about whistling jovially with his hands in his trousers pockets which were empty as usual was in striking contrast to his livery of woe
385,fontaine occasionally had spasms of fear concerning their ruse but at twentyfive with good appetite and enough to satisfy it with love and hope and friend like marsac one is apt to whistle jovially
386,in one corner of the room was with delicious supper set outsent from the restaurant which the two young men patronised liberally
387,on the rickety writing lay letter bearing the stamp of one of the leading theatres in paris
388,in the intervals of walking about and wondering why marsac was so late fontainepg 67 would read and reread this letter with the most evident delight
389,at last just as fontaine was beginning to be impatient in walked marsac carrying his violincase in his hand
390,he opened it without word and took out four bottles of champagne
391,then in solemn silence he removed his tall hat which proved to be full of flowers and these he arranged in the middle of the supper 
392,what are you up to now asked fontaine in surprise
393,ladies to supper gravely replied marsac
394,fontaine was astounded
395,marsac habitually ran away from respectable women declaring he was afraid of them and for those of another kind he had nothing but the pity of pg 68 refined and honourable soul which leaves to harder hearts and more evil natures the condemnation of those who sin because they are sinned against
396,fontaine uttered only one word ladies yes said marsac that is they are ladies to me and to youfor they are women halfstarved and hardworking
397,what does it matter that they are balletgirls in thirdrate theatre
398,listen
399,as i was coming home just now i saw these two poor creatures standing in front of pastry shop close by eying the cakes in the window and without sou to buy anything with
400,i overheard them as they sorrowfully recalled that their last franc had gone in white satin shoes for the ballet next week
401,i have been hungrypg 69 myself and so have you and i felt for them in my pockets as well as in my heart but i had no more money than they
402,i had credit though thanks to your admirable uncle maurice and good supper at home and i said to them that for once they should be warmed and filled
403,they are of grade in society that is not bound by conventionalities and were quite willing to go anywhere for good meal
404,so i told them to slip by the conciergethey will be here in few minutesand i went and got the wine and the flowers to make it little more of feast for the poor souls and you and i fontaine will be the better not the worse for this nights work marsac you are the best fellow that ever lived cried fontaine hugging him
405,fontaine was always hugging marsac and marsac always responded by pat on the  such as father gives small boy
406,and read this letter he continued thrusting the letterpg 70 in marsacs hand
407,it ran as follows m
408,auguste fontaine
409,my dear sirhappening some days ago to read an account of your deserved good fortune i remember having had some correspondence with you regarding playa white marriage i chanced to look in my box the same day and there discovered the play itself where it had lain whole year fate most unworthy of its great merit and which could only have occurred by the most astonishing forgetfulness on my part
410,i make you ten thousand apologies and assure you the loss is mine for since reading the piece i beg to have the honour of presenting it at the gaiet theatre
411,you have written play which must command success for i cannot understand it nor can the public and i presume no more can you
412,all you have to do therefore is to have it presented and then sit down and wait for the critics to explain the play to you as to the rest of the world
413,each one is bound to give different explanation they will get to quarrelling and your fortune will be made
414,it is essential in the drama of today to be complex and when you are so complex that nobody from the author down knows what the devil play is about or whatpg 71 problems you are proving or disproving you will be placed upon the same pinnacle with ibsen maaterlinck and the rest of the dutch shakspeares
415,ibsen or skirt dance is what goes nowadays
416,there is slight tendency to clearness in your  which must be remedied if you wish to be really great modern dramatist
417,and your play is not really vicious enough the wife merely gives her husband an opiate while she escapes with her lover instead of being driven by an imperative fate to give him about quart of corrosive sublimate
418,but these are minor faults in work of great villany obscurity and prolixity which i hope to have the privilege of presenting
419,yours truly m
420,savary manager of the gaiet theatre
421,fontaine capered about gleefully while marsac read this letter and then handed him another note which seemed to give him almost equal pleasure
422,it was from picturedealer and briefly announced that an offer of thousand francs had been made for a rough sea and he hesitated about taking it there was price marked on the picturefiftypg 72 something it couldnt be fifty francs
423,but it was fifty francs all the same cried marsac and thousand francs
424,good heavens
425,we shall be as rich as the rothschilds and we shall be able to get away from these quarters and that dreadful woman downstairs and i shall marry you to claire duval fontaines reply to this was humming little song with refrain claire i love thee which presently made him sigh and look very gloomy
426,marsac who knew what turn his thoughts were taking said slyly i met old duval today fontaine jumped as if he had been shot
427,and what did he say
428,how is claire
429,when are you going to let me out of this infernal confinement so i can go to see the darling fie
430,fie
431,and you an engaged man cried marsac at which fontaine groaned and tore his hair
432,butpg 73 continued marsac i have some good news for you
433,old duval has read all the accounts of uncle maurice and has the most childlike faith in him and i declare auguste i begin to believe in the old fellow myself
434,anyhow monsieur duval talked with me whole hour this afternoon and you may depend upon it i stuffed him and the result isnow dont go crazythat he more than hinted at match between you and claire fontaine fell on the sofa in an ecstasy murmuring dear darling claire and he is coming to see you very soon to congratulate you
435,i told him you were going nowhere on account of your recent bereavement and listen to this
436,the old fellow wants to oblige you and as i mentioned by way of corroborative testimony that you were looking round for countryseat he said he would sell you villa he has at melun for ninety thousandpg 74 francs
437,now i know that maurepas our editorinchief is wild for that villa and i have reason to think he will give hundred and forty thousand francs for it
438,do you see yes said fontaine
439,i buy it for ninety thousand and sell it for hundred and forty thousand
440,but will it work not if you jump down old duvals throat when he offers it to you i shant be able to prevent it then you will be unworthy of your uncle maurice and i shall be sorry to have provided you with such relative a sound was heard outside
441,marsac listened intently thinking it to be his two friends of the ballet but it proved not
442,i wonder as much afraid as you are of women said fontaine that you should have had the courage to ask those two poor creatures here even for the pleasure of doing kind actionforpg 75 nothing gives you so much pleasure as that pooh replied marsac
443,it is not women i fear it is matrimony and i show my regard for the sex by remaining bachelor
444,i feel that by not marrying i shall secure one woman at least from eternal misery again there was noise outside the door and this time it was the two balletgirlsmademoiselle marie and mademoiselle louise as they introduced themselves
445,marsac receivedpg 76 them with as much kindness and respect as if they had been bankers daughters and as for the girls themselves they were tawdry yet shabby and extraordinarily painted and bedizened
446,but the of womanhood was not extinguished in them and modesty itself would not have been abashed in the presence of the four assembled in the garret of no
447,17 rue montignal
448,mademoiselle marie and mademoiselle louise wished to be extremely elegant in the company in which they found themselves but it must be admitted that they laughed rather loud and talked excessively
449,however their account of the way in which they slipped past the entresol was very amusing and the two young men roared with laughter and then the fun began
450,but at the very moment that two corks flew out with loud report the door came open with bang and madame schmid stalked in
451,pg 77 not banquos ghost made greater sensation at party than this stout alsatian
452,fontaine following his usual tactics ran behind the screen
453,madame schmid with one rapid glance at the and the champagne uttered but one word thieves and made dash for fontaine whom she collared and dragged out
454,pg 78 oh you pretty boy she screamed this is your povertychampagne and oysters and giving parties when you cant pay your washbill
455,i used to feel sorry for you when you were so poor but now i know you are rolling in money with twenty million francs left you in america and owing poor woman two hundred francs for washingthat is you and that slicktongued marsac yonder marsac was not yonder but directly behind madame schmid and holding big tumbler of champagne in one hand while with the other he deftly seized her round the waist and began pouring the champagne down her throat
456,at the same time he was talking her down in vigorous tones shouting my dear girl you really oughtnt to come here
457,it will ruin our reputations to have handsome young thing like you found in our apartment madame schmid sputtering protesting but obliged to drink the champagnepg 79 willynilly was still able to make good deal of noise
458,oh you hypocrite
459,you cant honeyfuggle me gurgle gurgle gurgle the champagne flowed down her throat
460,honeyfuggle you
461,oh you bewitching creature you honeyfuggle me
462,another glass fontaine another tumbler followed the first madame schmid trying to say stop hugging me you impudent the young ladies enjoyed this excessively and before the second glass was wholly disposed of madame schmid was struggling with the emotions produced by the champagne marsacs flattery and wrath at her unpaid bill but being thrifty alsatian the last was by no means forgotten
463,suddenly amid all the laughing choking joking and commotion voice was heard calling at the foot of the stairs monsieur marsac
464,monsieur fontaine
465,open the door and help me uppg 80 these confounded narrow stairs
466,i am not built for such alpine work as this great heavens
467,it is old duval exclaimed fontaine who had dropped limp into chair at the first sound of this voice
468,go and keep him below for moment said marsac and with wonderful quickness he hustled the two girls nothing loath into the closet where they willingly shut the door tittering at their own predicament
469,it was something else though to get rid of madame schmid
470,marsac had almost to drag her to the corridor door she fighting like tiger and marsac assuring her that it would forever destroy them should young and handsome woman like her be found in their apartment
471,barely was she shoved out and scarcely had marsac time to seat himself in meditative attitude with book when fontaine with old duval entered and while greeting him marsacpg 81 could hear madame schmid prancing up and down the corridor in her wrath
472,monsieur duval broad rubicund benevolent conceited and with the true auriferous air which belongs to the vulgar rich congratulated fontaine on his accession of fortune
473,fontaine received this modestly while marsac eulogised uncle maurice and pointed out the goodness indicated in every feature of the portrait hanging on the wall
474,yes yes said monsieur duval you have had great stroke of luck young man and i hope you will be worthy of it to which fontaine replied that he hoped to prove himself entirely worthy of his uncle maurices goodness
475,and now cried monsieur duval swelling out his waistcoat i must tell you that i have other objects in calling to see you tonight besides congratulating you on your good fortune 82 one is to sell you piece of property at melun and the other is to ask you both to dine with me at my passy villa very soon
476,i wish you to meet my niece delphine who has lately come to live with my daughter and me
477,would tomorrow suit perfectly cried fontaine eagerly but was checked by marsac with look
478,i think you have the poorest memory i ever saw said marsac severely to fontaine
479,have you forgotten that tomorrow we dine with the prince and next day with the marshal the day after with the archbishop duval little staggered by these magnificent names remarked i thought you told me today that monsieur fontaine was not going into society on account of his mourning so he is not coolly responded marsac
480,these are merely little family affairs with people we have always known pg 83 this did not make old duval any the less anxious to have them and he named day the next week which marsac and fontaine after an elaborate consultation of their notebooks finally found they could accept
481,and now about the villa said the old brewer standing with his feet wide apart and his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets
482,its very pretty place at melun my daughter is very fond of it and if you are looking for country place monsieur fontaine you could not do better than take it at ninety thousand francs fontaine remembering marsacs injunction not to be too eager hummed and had little for effect
483,he was deeply indebted to monsieur duval for his offer ninety thousand was pg 84 mere bagatelle etc
484,old duval persisted and his motive was ridiculously clear every other word was my daughter is fond of the melun placemy daughter could scarcely be persuaded to leave it even for our finer house at passy marsac urged the apparently unwilling fontaine to accept the offer mentioning several countesses duchesses and princesses of their acquaintance who thought about buying places at melun
485,at every mention of  the old brewer rose to the bait and was perfectly happy man when fontaine agreed to take the place at ninety thousand and expressed his gratitude to monsieur duval for favouring him with the purchase
486,the old man then got on the subject of his daughter varied with digressions on his niece delphine which seemed to amuse him very much
487,a fine handsome girl she is but the new woman with vengeance 85 believes in womans having mission and all that and is as deadly opposed to matrimony as our friend marsacat which monsieur duval cackled and chuckled with great enjoyment for some time
488,by the way he continued i expect her and my daughter to call for me on their way from dinner and they will be here before long
489,monsieur fontaine will you oblige me by telling the porter to direct them to wait awhile in case i should not be quite ready to go monsieur duval had an object in getting fontaine out of the way for the moment the door closed upon him he drew his chair up to marsacs and began very seriously and mopping his forehead in his anxiety you know monsieur marsac i have always thought extremely well of monsieur fontaine and now that he has come into snug fortune i should not mind if heif my daughter herepg 86 monsieur duval winked and marsac grinned appreciatively
490,i understand perfectly answered marsac
491,about ten millions i hear remarked monsieur duval in whisper
492,oh no no replied marsac deprecatingly
493,that is gross exaggeration
494,i give you my word monsieur duval it is nothing like that
495,i know more about the matter than anybody except fontaine and i assure you that it is but two millions and how do you think monsieur fontaine feels toward my daughter marsac knitted his brows thoughtfully
496,i really dont know he said at last i have never heard fontaine mention mademoiselle claire except in general terms but i know she is very charming girl and any man might be glad and proud to have her
497,but monsieur duval said marsac confidentially you have no idea how the poor fellow has been persecuted withpg 87 propositions of the sort since his uncle maurices death
498,at the club the dukes and marquises are sometimes four deep around him all with an eye on having him for soninlaw and as for the widows the poor fellow has had to insure his life against their eating him up this whetted old duvals desire considerably
499,marsac seeing this kept on
500,now here is letter from the prince de landais taking up landaiss billi assure you neither of us knows the man except in business wayand here he writes not only wanting fontaine to marry his daughter but actually asking for money in advanceabout six hundred and seventyfive francsand he takes the tone of person already entitled to it a wretched aristocratic pauper cried old duval indignantly
501,at least the man who marries my claire will not have worthless fatherinlawpg 88 like this prince de landais to prey upon him and here is letter from madame schmid or rather the baroness schmidmarsac made this addition seeing how quickly monsieur duval had jumped at every he had named
502,she is very particular about her  because she has just got one
503,this woman is great swell but rude coarse creature old enough to be fontaines mother and was once washerwoman i am told
504,by the wayhere marsac put his mouth to old duvals earshe comes to this apartment in pursuit of him
505,he keeps out of her way refuses to answer her letters and then she pursues him here
506,she was in this room when you were announced below and it was with the greatest difficulty we got her out
507,she is in the corridor still i believe marsac rose and taking the old brewer by the hand they tipped topg 89 the corridor door
508,monsieur duval knelt down and through the keyhole saw madame schmid rampaging up and down the corridor like caged lioness
509,great heavens whispered old duval no one can blame monsieur fontaine from running away from such woman scarcely were the words out of his mouth when madame schmid making lunge at the door it flew open knocking monsieur duval sprawling
510,madame schmid dashed in walking over the prostrate monsieur duval as if he had been frog and began to harangue marsac violently swinging her arms about like dutch windmill
511,oh you deceiver
512,i know it isnt worth while to do anything with monsieurpg 90 fontaineyou have him under your thumb but i will bring you both to terms that i promise you
513,and where has monsieur fontaine gone
514,you have spirited him out of the wayi know it you do it every time i come marsacs only reply was to catch her round the waist and say soothingly as he dragged her back to the door my dear girl you will certainly ruin fontaines reputation if you act in this manner i dont care fig for my reputation bawled madame schmidit is money i am after and money i mean to have out of monsieur fontaine marsac managed to get her outside the door which he took the precaution to lock behind her and said as he stepped back into the room thats sample of what poor fontaine has had to put up with since he came into his money
515,and there is another one widowwho is worse than all pg 91 oh jupiter was monsieur duvals exclamation as he picked himself up off the floor and dusted his knees and elbows
516,a very handsome woman comtessethe comtesse de fleury
517,she got written promise out of fontaine in moment of weaknessyou understand yes widow and moment of weakness
518,i understand said the old brewer feelingly
519,it isnt of the slightest legal value though as i can testify that it was obtained under duress and fontaine would give half he is worth to get rid of her as marsac said this about the written agreement he could not help wishing with all his heart that he had it that moment in his possession
520,monsieur duval reflected seriously for some minutes before speaking
521,i acknowledge to you he said that i regard widow in an affair of this sortpg 92 as person to be reckoned with and it is i who tell you so and i have on my shoulders
522,now i hear you have great influence with monsieur fontaine not particle marsac protested vigorously
523,nonsense
524,you are trying to fool me
525,but i will say this to you
526,taking into account my daughters fancy for your friend fontaine and his good character and his good birth and his fortune if you can bring about anarrangementyou understandit will be for the happiness of the young people i would do anything for fontaines happiness said marsac
527,then couldnt youahemthe widownow you are yourself very attractive fellow
528,perhaps the widow might make an exchange take me do you mean
529,my dear sir i would do anything on earth for fontaine but one and that is to get married pg 93 ha
530,ha
531,thats the way delphine talks i havent the remotest idea how to make an offer
532,it would be like horse trying to play the fiddle oh well you need not mind about that with widow
533,she will do the business for you she shall not have chance if i can help itthat is stammered marsac as he recollected that madame fleury had already proposed to him
534,to be very confidential this particular widow haserbefore entangling fontainein an interview with me marsac stopped blushing and monsieur duval closing one eye playfully poked him in the ribs
535,my dear young friend said he with an air of superior wisdom she did not want you very much else she would have hadpg 94 you
536,even i have had to use all my astuteness to keep from being gobbled up by widows
537,eternal vigilance is the price of liberty where widows are concerned
538,but if you wont listen to my proposition in that respect i am sure you will to one upon another subject
539,i intend next month reorganising my breweries into stock company and i have positive assurances that the shares will command premium
540,if you and your friend fontaine can raise ten thousand francs within the next week i can let you in on the ground floor and within three weeks you will make fifty thousand francs each you shall have my cheque tomorrow morning promptly answered marsac who had not sou to his credit or in hand
541,old duval then began to examine the room
542,the supper seemed to strike him favourably but the room did not
543,it seems to me he saidpg 95 thatahemyour friend might have better quarters
544,this is pretty high up yes answered marsac but we remain here on account of the widow the comtesse de fleury and our surroundings are more valuable than you think perhaps
545,we have been collectors in our time i assure you
546,do you see that sofa yes said monsieur duval punching the poor old sofa but its motheaten
547,it ought to be mended here it would be sacrilege to touch that sofa
548,it belonged to peter the great
549,he made that hole in it
550,i forget exactly what we paid for it but it is insured for forty thousand francs monsieur duvals mouth came wide open with surprise
551,and this mirror kept on marsac pursuing his advantage
552,it is crackedbut by whom
553,by madame pompadour
554,one day the king was very disobliging to her and she flew into pg 96 passion
555,she picked up  here marsac halted but his eye travelling round the room fell on their rusty bellows he resumed glibly she picked up pair of bellows and threw them at the king
556,his majesty dodged and smash went the bellows against the mirrorand here are the veritable bellows
557,the mirror and bellows are worth together about twentyfive thousand francs old duval examined them with the highest respect
558,i see said he they are immensely valuable and do you see this violin marsac handed the old brewer the violin
559,ah cried monsieur duval delighted to show he knew something about violins  stradivarius perhaps my dear sir said marsac in tone of pity that violin was old when stradivarius was young
560,it is the identical instrument that nero fiddled on when rome was burning pg 97 this reduced monsieur duval to an amazed silence during which they heard laughter and voices on the stairs and the door opened admitting fontaine and two remarkably pretty girls
561,dear papa cried one of them just as we got to the door the wheel came off the carriage and the coachman had to go to stable after another carriageand monsieur fontaine brought us up here quite right replied monsieur duval looking fondly at his daughter
562,you know monsieur marsac but i must present him to you delphine
563,oh you two should get on famouslyyou are both such haters of marriage the instant marsacs eyes lighted on delphine he felt singular sensation
564,she was slight and tall with patrician beauty of face and  and an air of selfpossession second onlypg 98 to madame fleurys
565,delphine too felt an instant attraction toward marsac with his bright eyes his alert look of intelligence and his gentlemanly 
566,this perception of marsacs charm caused her to say lightly yet with faint blush i am not exactly hater of marriage
567,i only regard it as primitive and somewhat unintelligent arrangement the effect of these few words from the lips of woman he had seen but sixty seconds produced strange effect on marsac
568,he felt slight chill of disappointment but he answered in his old strain just what i have often longed to say mademoiselle but never had the courage but i have remarked delphine showing her beautiful teeth in smile
569,women you know have much more real courage than men
570,especially is this true in times of great calamity pg 99 yes indeed said marsac with energy
571,i have often noticed at the wedding ceremony the bride is always much more composed than the groom being launched into the discussion delphines next blow at the masculine sex was this one phase of the question has frequently occurred to me
572,does the higher education unfit men for marriage marsac shook his  unable to find an answer to this proposition which he frankly acknowledged had never before presented itself to him
573,fontaine and claire had listened to this in silence but the furtive looks exchanged between them showed silent protest against it and also very deep interest in each other
574,old duval laughed at the discussion between marsac and delphine and then they gathered round the to have glass of champagne while waiting for the carriage
575,both the young men urged monsieur duval and the youngpg 100 ladies to partake of what marsac called their frugal supper and monsieur duval chuckled at the idea of such frugality while declining it
576,the young people talked gaily together while sipping champagne and blessed the coachman for taking so long to bring another carriage
577,marsac and delphine seemed to find it impossible to get away from the question of marriage albeit they tried topg 101 outdo each other in railing at it
578,delphine declared that woman should keep her eyes open at the moment of marrying even the best of men and marsac recommended that she should keep her eyes half shut ever afterward
579,claire charmed fontaine by saying sweetly after this i should scorn to watch the man i married
580,i should want to have every confidence in him then mademoiselle you would need to kill him immediately after the ceremony counselled marsac
581,then the conversation turned on uncle maurice
582,marsac and fontaine had number of readymade anecdotes respecting the old man and his honourable career in new york which they told with gravity and effect
583,marsac declared that he felt like going in mourning himself so grateful was he for what uncle maurice had done for fontaine while fontaine with perfect truth said that he thought more of hispg 102 uncle maurice than of any relative he had in the world
584,every moment passed in one anothers society drew these four young hearts closer togetherfontaine and claire willingly and marsac and delphine loudly protesting and abusing the emotions which just born in their hearts yet grew like jonahs gourd
585,at last however this accidental halfhourwhich brought so much happiness to fontaine and claire and turned the world topsyturvy for marsac and delphinecame to an end
586,the carriage was reported the duval party rose to go after the two young men had reiterated their promise to dine on the saturday at passy old duval saying of course it is most kind of you to come to us with all your engagements with marshals and dukes and princes but with significant look at marsac some of those titled people you want to keep at long range pg 103 especially the prince de landais and the baroness schmid boldly responded marsac
587,the door was open and the duvals were going out after saying goodbye for the tenth time when the two young men saw coming up the stairs the compact and shrewd face of maurepas their editorinchief
588,he met old duval face to face on the landing
589,delighted to see you monsieur duval cried maurepas
590,i was going to see you tomorrow but if you will pardon busy man for introducing business just let me ask you to give me the refusal of that villa you have at melun until i can get to see you sorry to disappoint you but it is the day after the ball
591,i have just in effect sold it to monsieur fontaine replied monsieur duval going on downstairs
592,maurepas entered the room with the air of chagrined man and throwing down his hat said crossly pg 104 so fontaine that newspaper story is true and you have come into great fortune not so very great answered fontaine modestlyonly couple of million francs oh lord sniffed maurepas how our ideas have expanded
593,well i am glad your old uncle cut up so handsomely monsieur maurepas said marsac severely i beg you will at least respect fontaines mourning attire
594,it is exceedingly painful to us to have monsieur maurice fontaines death alluded to in that flippant and heartless manner monsieur maurepas sniffed louder than ever but did not pursue the objectionable subject
595,well he said i suppose fontaine will give up journalism now i dont know responded fontaine dubiously i always liked my profession pg 105 in that case replied maurepas i will make you an offer
596,i know what you can do fontaine could not forbear remarking you used to say i couldnt do anything my dear fellow answered maurepas coolly that was before you were talked about
597,now as the most talkedabout young man in paris your name is worth something to newspaper even if your ideas are not
598,i will make you this proposition
599,if you will give la lune three signed articles week of thousand words each i will give you five hundred francs week
600,i make but one stipulationyour name must be signed to them but marsac must write them fontaine hesitated for moment but marsac answered for him done and another thing
601,there is to be great journalists dinner given on the 17th and i want you when called upon to make speech in the namepg 106 of the younger members of the staff of la lune i couldnt
602,i wouldnt
603,i never made speech in my life but you could
604,whats the matter with marsac composing the speech and your delivering it none in the world answered marsac laughing
605,so you can put him down for the 17th and now about the melun villa continued maurepas after making memorandum in his notebook
606,i dare not go home to my wife without the promise of that place
607,i told her i would see monsieur duval today but i forgot it
608,i dont know what you paid for it but i will give you hundred thousand francs for it the prospect of making clear ten thousand francs delighted fontaine so that he could not speak for momentwhen catching marsacs eye fixed upon him he understood the signal and gave an evasive answer whichpg 107 maurepas poohpoohed
609,marsac then interfered
610,the fact is he said with his most candid manner i am against you there monsieur maurepas
611,i want fontaine to keep the villa
612,he wants to buy great hotel on the avenue de lalma for seven hundred and fifty thousand francs
613,i tell him it is much too expensive for him and i dont think his uncle maurice would have approved of it fontaine had never heard of the avenue de lalma house but he assented promptly
614,maurepas however being intensely anxious for the villa cut short the discussion about the avenue de lalma house by offering one hundred and ten thousand francs for the villa
615,fontaine dying to accept glanced at marsac who began to whistle softly
616,maurepas growing more eager jumped his bid immediately to one hundred and twenty thousand francs
617,fontaine thought marsac crazypg 108 when he rose buttoned his coat and said pray excuse us monsieur maurepas
618,we have an engagement at little supper tonight at the archbishopsquite an informal little affair a hundred and thirty thousand francs cried maurepas
619,i am great fool but marsac handed fontaines crapecovered hat to him
620,a hundred and forty thousand for the villa and may the devil take it said maurepas in desperation
621,no joyfully shouted fontaine who saw acquiescence in marsacs eye
622,ill take it make one condition my dear fellow said marsac earnestly to fontaine
623,if you will be such fool as to sell the villa make monsieur maurepaspg 109 promise you not to mention the price to monsieur duval
624,the old gentleman thought he was selling it to you for mere song and he will never forgive you if he finds out you resold it immediately at so small an advance yes yes said fontaine and maurepas who was making out little memorandum of the transaction added readily yes yes
625,i will not mention it stop cried marsac
626,it would be as well to tell monsieur duval that fontaine got large advance on it
627,that will reconcile old duval to his selling it ill tell the old fellow anything you like
628,only sign this little memorandum fontaine and you can pass the papers over directly to me as soon as you get them
629,and if you will take cheque to bind the bargain fontaine could scarcely refrain from embracing the editor on the spot butpg 110 obeying telegraphic signal from marsac he merely said if it is any inconvenience to you it is not the slightest and it will please my wife to know it is settled answered maurepas taking out chequebook and rapidly writing cheque for twenty thousand francs
630,in ten minutes the informal but binding agreement was made and signed and maurepas took his departure
631,fontaine and marsac left alone sat looking intently at each other simply stunned by their good fortune
632,marsac finding words unable to express his rapture turned double handspring over the sofa when fontaine rushing up to him hugged and kissed him violently
633,after this they stood grasping each other for five minutes in silent rapture when marsacs countenance losingpg 111 its blissful expression became suddenly grave
634,fontaine this is glorious but tell me one thing
635,what is that singular sensation which i felt the instant my eyes rested on delphine
636,i feel it now
637,it is most peculiar and penetrating and although agitating not unpleasant love you idiot you alarm me said marsac anxiously
638,tell me it is something less dangerous  locomotor ataxia or paresis i have been told the symptoms are somewhat alike i tell you that you are in love with delphine just as i am in love with my sweet claire and you need not fight and struggle against it
639,love is lord of all
640,no man has lived until he has loved but is there no way out of love
641,a course of plato and low diet not particle of good pg 112 marsac relapsed into gloom until fontaine whacking him on the back cried exultingly think marsac twenty thousand francs in hand thirty thousand more coming forty thousand francs profit each from the brewery shares we can now buy thousand francs for picture play placed clothes enough for two yearshurrah for uncle maurice hurrah
642,hurrah
643,hurrah
644,for uncle maurice shouted marsac capering wildly about
645,fontaine ran and opened the closet door to let out the two balletgirls who had gone to sleep
646,he pulled them out and began dancing gaily with them while marsac finding madame schmid at the keyhole listening dragged her in out of the corridor and seizing her round the waist began to waltz furiously both of them hurrahing for uncle maurice at the top of their lungs and singing doggerel verses madepg 113 up as they danced and all ending with joyous refrain of houpl
647,for uncle maurice pg 114 chapter iii the dinner at passy resulted in several things
648,fontaine and claire could no longer conceal their infatuation with each other and tacit engagement ensued to be announced as soon as fontaine could free himself wholly from madame fleurywhich meant as soon as she gave up the pursuit of him
649,the two friends had escaped from under the roof of 17 rue montignal by the exercise of an ingenuity akin to that which enables men to dig under castle walls to steal past sentries and to find their way over prison gates
650,they secretly hired another lodging and to avoid suspicion made no move toward paying their rent to madame fleury in spite of their coming intopg 115 ready money
651,this apparent absence of cash led her to believe more than ever that the story of the rich uncle was an invention of marsacs
652,they had little to move except their new clothes and uncle maurices portrait
653,for week before their flight every day they came downstairs whistling and wearing two and sometimes three suits of clothes which they shed as snake sheds his skin at their new lodgings
654,at last in the dead of night they crept softly out of their apartment leaving on the note addressed to madame fleury enclosing the full amount of their indebtedness and stealing downstairsmarsac with his violin case and fontaine with uncle maurices portraitthey gained the streetpg 116 where they ran as if satan were after them
655,madame fleurys chagrin next morning was excessive particularly when she read the note in which marsac thanked her ironically for her hospitality to them
656,she had not the smallest clew to their whereabouts but she went to work quietly to find them out
657,meanwhile marsac and fontaine having her out of sight were not disposed to trouble themselves further about her but old duval naturally wished his daughter to avoid any scandal which might arise over the affair and was very solicitous that madame fleury be settled with
658,let sleeping dogs lie was marsacs motto and he was not inclined to hunt up madame fleury in order to get formal release from her
659,meanwhile the catastrophe indicated at the very first meeting between marsac and delphine had fallen out in the most violent manner
660,they fell mutually in love with precipitancepg 117 to which even claire and fontaines ardour was not patch
661,but although there was disaffection in the citadel of both their hearts pride and policy made brave show of defence when really each only waited the demand from the other to surrender
662,marsac dared not propose to delphine that to secure himself the charm of her society he enslave her in marriage
663,to ward off the suspicions which might arise in her mind from the sly jokes and hints of the two confessed lovers he gibed at marriage more keenly than ever
664,delphine who was not whit behind marsac in falling in love scorned to be outdone and railed at love and marriage quoted plato and nordau and made herself miserable in manner truly feminine
665,old duval was bent on the match between his daughter and fontainethe more so as marsac informed him confidentially that fontaine had two more uncles in america and an aged and infirm aunt all of whom intendedpg 118 to make him their heir and each of whom was over eighty years of age
666,the two young men were much at passy and the invitations elsewhere which they had once been forced to invent now really existed
667,the whole face of existence indeed was changed for themfor marsac as for fontaine
668,fontaine had always thought marsac the cleverest fellow in the world and he now ranked him with napoleon and alexander the great
669,the play had been produced and was immensely successful the picture had been exhibited and highly praised while at the journalists dinner marsacs speech delivered by fontaine had marked fontaine forever as born afterdinner speaker and man of esprit
670,this last reputation was amply confirmed by the brilliant articles signed by fontaine and written by marsac which sparkled three times week upon the pages of la lune in short it appeared as if the mere report of pg 119 fortune of two million francs was enough to produce two million francs
671,but the real fact was that marsac hitherto an unappreciated genius had risen to the great occasion offered him and his success was not that of charlatan
672,it was that of man of parts accomplishments and that large generosity which does good thing and troubles not that the world gives the credit to some one else
673,and as everybody believed in the defunct uncle maurice fontaine and marsac actually seemed to be deceived by their own illusion and would talk quite gravely between themselves of uncle mauricehis tastes his habits and his appearance
674,as for the real uncle maurice nothing more had been heard of him and the two young men easily persuaded themselves that nothing would
675,in any event they did not intend to cross the bridge until they came to it and some of the advantages gained by the fictitious uncle werepg 120 of so solid nature that even if uncle maurice turned up he could not rob them of the entire fruits of their scheme
676,one bright evening early in may they had dined at passy and after dinner sat with the two girls and old duval on the terrace
677,the evening was warm for the season and coffee was served out of doors
678,after while delphine who carried volume of plato about with her as her oriflamme of battle asked marsac to read something to them from the great philosopher
679,this marsac promptly agreed to if delphine would hold candlewhich would be necessary in the fading light
680,as it brought delphines golden quite close to marsacs closely cropped brown one she consented willingly
681,old duval who had but poor opinion of plato sauntered off to the other end of the terrace close by the hedge which overlooked the highroad
682,a with coffeepg 121 iced champagne and cigars mitigated his solitude
683,afar off in the dark illumined by the wax candle which looked like firefly marsac read plato aloud with assent on his lips and contradiction in his heart
684,fontaine and claire exchanging laughing glances varied by an occasional tender pressure of the hands half listened while delphine happy to be near marsac and smilingpg 122 at him yet cherished bitterness against him in her heart for his professed disdain of love
685,presently monsieur duval was heard calling monsieur marsac marsac to whom plato had become wellnigh intolerable laid the book down with vicious slam and walked to the other end of the terrace where they were almost out of sight and hearing
686,come said the old man goodhumouredly havent you had enough of that old fool plato my dear monsieur duval you horrify me you pain me responded marsac in shocked voice
687,platothe platomay go to the devil was his inward conclusion
688,well well continued monsieur duval we wont say anything more on the subject since you and delphine are so touchy about it
689,take glass of champagneyou like it i am not afraid of it said marsac pouring out glass
690,pg 123 monsieur duval sighed fidgeted and then burst out with do you know i am afraidi am afraid i have been to blame in letting my daughter and monsieur fontaine see so much of each other while matters are still so uncertain about the comtesse de fleury for i see the two young people are deeply in love with each other
691,now he continued with smile there is no such danger for you and delphine for i believe you talk about nothing except the folly of loving and being loved true responded marsac gloomily and trying to drown in champagne the resentment he felt at the scurvy trick which fate had played him
692,monsieur fontaine is very gifted young fellow said monsieur duval
693,he is replied marsac with enthusiasm
694,that picture he painted admirable i have no objections to manspg 124 knowing something about art if he can sell his pictures said monsieur duval with cautious praise
695,there wasahemmichael angelo for example michael angelo was devil of fellow with brush and paintpot but the man who painted fontaines picture wasnt far behind him and that play literally screaming success
696,the women are carried out in hysterics at every performance
697,one of them we hoped would die from excitement
698,it would have been worth five thousand francs advertising
699,but unfortunately she recovered just when our prospects seemed brightest and the speech at the journalists dinner the greatest effort of myi mean of fontaines life those signed articles are making sensation ah yes many night have i satpg 125 up writingthat is reading those articles
700,depend upon it the things that go under fontaines name are very remarkable at that moment footman approached and handed marsac card saying the lady asked for monsieur fontaine marsac was about to hand the card back when he happened to see on it madame fleury stop he cried instantly give me moment to think
701,monsieur duval here is the comtesse de fleury come after fontaine
702,she must not see him monsieur duval jumped up flurried and anxious to be out of the way at the coming scene
703,good heavens
704,let me get away
705,i must keep my poor child out of sight
706,and fontaine monsieur duval waddled off making remarkably good time for gentleman of his years but returned to say impressively take care shepg 126 doesnt bamboozle you
707,you need two pairs of eyes to watch and four legs to run away where widow is concerned and then he disappeared
708,show the lady here said marsac with assumed calmness and at the same time taking another glass of champagne to steady his nerves
709,in minute or two he saw madame fleurys imposing advancing along the gravelled walk and then she had mounted the terrace steps and was gliding over the velvet turf toward him
710,as usual she was perfectly well dressed
711,her bonnet was set on her with the grace of coronet
712,in one hand she carried parasol and in the other silver cardcase
713,marsac advanced politely to meet her and the two exchanged bows as pugilists shake hands on entering the ring
714,madame fleury lost no time in proceeding to business
715,monsieur marsac i have been at great deal of trouble to find you but as you seepg 127 i have succeeded
716,i wish to see monsieur fontaine in regard to the engagement between us is there an engagement between you asked marsac innocently
717,of what nature may i ask madame fleury smiled scornfully at marsacs pretended ignorance
718,if it be true that he has come into fortune then i am the more determined that our contract shall be fulfilled on the 15th of this month
719,i acknowledge though that i have not yet been able to persuade myself fully of this old uncles death or even of his previous existence because you have had too much to do with the affair this indeed is humiliating said marsac with an offended air
720,but madame uncle or no uncle let me beg of you to give up this pursuit of fontaine
721,he loves another womanperhaps not so beautiful or attractive as you but still he loves her
722,i can invent some plausible story topg 128 account for your coming here
723,i will introduce monsieur duval to you he will i guarantee offer to send you back to paris in superb victoria no i thank you in brougham then
724,the brougham is very handsome
725,i will also introduce you as the comtesse de fleurythink of thatcoming from paris as madame fleury in cab returning as the comtesse de fleury in splendid private carriage madame fleury only laughed little at this
726,i know what your offers to serve me mean and also how much goodwill you owe me do you doubt madame that i have the very highest regard for you
727,try me
728,there is just behind the house well sixty feet deep and the water of an icy coldness
729,just you jump in and see how quickly i will jump in after you to save you madame fleury laughed more than ever as she declined this and said banteringlypg 129 how could i believe you considering that when i made you an offer you refused me oh madame fleury cried marsac actually hanging his  surely i said my affections were engagedoror i asked time for considerationor i was too young to marryor something of the sort
730,i did not put it in that brutally frank fashion in which you represent me yes you did replied madame fleury
731,but i like your proposition that i shall meet monsieur duval
732,i know good deal about him and his family but i have never seen him and this is an admirable opportunity the world called marsac clever man but at that moment he felt himself to be the greatest lunkhead in existence
733,what had he mentioned oldpg 130 duvals name for
734,and at that very moment the old brewers curiosity having got the better of his cowardice he was seen advancing across the terrace
735,there was no help for it and marsac with very bad grace had to present him to the widow
736,madame fleury was perfect mistress of the art of coquetry as applied to elderly gentlemen
737,she turned her eyes upon monsieur duval with melting glance that would have put younger man on his guard
738,not so monsieur duval
739,it had been long time since woman so young and handsome had made eyes at him and he relished it exceedingly
740,all his precautions against widows were thrown to the four winds of heaven
741,marsac almost groaned aloud as he saw in five minutes talk the widow sailing into the old fellows good graces
742,monsieur duval offered madame fleury glass of champagne and when the two sat down together on rustic bench marsacpg 131 was so overcome with chagrin at the chance he had given his enemy that he turned his back and walked toward the edge of the terrace
743,madame fleury improved her opportunity
744,she drew closer to monsieur duval and from tapping his hand gently with her cardcase soon grew to letting her hand rest on his while she poured into his ears the story of her alleged engagement to fontaine
745,according to her account fontaine had pursued her and by his importunity had made her consent to an engagement which he now refused to fulfil
746,her desire for settlement of the question was simply to avoid scandal and she dwelt so upon the impossibility of her feeling any affection for so young man as fontaine and the chance she sacrificed of meeting man old enough to please her that old duval began seriously to fear that his own agesixtysevenwas callow and immature
747,pg 132 after fifteen minutes of this had gone on marsac turned round and glanced at the pair
748,it was still light enough to see
749,madame fleury had reached the weeping stage
750,her left hand pressed handkerchief to her eyes while monsieur duval patting her right was saying tenderly there there dont cry ah if one has heart one must suffer murmured madame fleury with beautiful little sob and pressing lacetrimmed handkerchief to her eyes
751,and i have heart too impulsive nature too unsophisticated i see it i know it was old duvals fervent answer
752,it is that charming simplicity that inability to take care of your dear little self that wins upon me pg 133 i am so weak whispered madame fleury squeezing his hand
753,pray forgive me
754,you are so goodi know you are so good yes yes ill forgive you marsac heard old duval answer although what he was forgiving her he could not have told to save his life and it is thousand shames that any man should cause that innocent little heart of yours to ache
755,now wouldnt it be better for all parties if you and fontaine could separate amicably
756,and then you might find some other man that you could love old duval at this stuck his sentimentally on one side
757,a mature man monsieur duval said madame fleury wiping her eyes
758,i have had enough of young men
759,it is impossible for me to feel passionate regard for any man under sixtyfive at the least at this old duval assumed seraphic air which fairly made marsacpg 134 who could see it all perfectly ill with disgust
760,nevertheless knowing that madame fleury and her victim both wished him out of the way he continued to stand his ground stoutly walking up and down and whistling loudly and contemptuously as their voices sank to the sentimental pitch
761,presently he saw madame fleury take carefully out of her cardcase folded slip of paper which she read in low voice to the old brewer
762,marsacs heart jumped into his mouth at the thought that it was the marriage contract she was reading
763,monsieur duval kept looking toward marsac with the evident desire to get rid of him
764,presently he rose and walked over to where marsac stood and began to whisper in an embarrassed manner i say monsieur marsacpray pardon me for askingwould youerahbe kind enough to tell meexcuse me for inquiring herepg 135 the old fellow burst out explosively what the devil are you sticking here for because answered marsac i thought you would like the protection of my presence under the circumstances welli dont and then it occurred to me that you had once suggested i should myself make an offer to madame fleury
765,the lady is here also the moon nightingales flowers and other incentives to romance i withdraw that suggestion monsieur marsac i have not asked to have it withdrawn monsieur duval oooh groaned old duval
766,then suddenly the absurdity of marsacs making love to any woman overcame him and he burst out laughing this tickles me under the fifth rib
767,delphine must know it it was now marsacs turn to be chagrined
768,pg 136 my dear sir he cried i beg of you not to mention it to mademoiselle delphine
769,it was mere idle remark
770,as you have frequently heard me say my ideal of woman is platonist
771,i would not marry any other and no platonist would marry me so you perceive the utter baselessness of my language i do answered old duval looking much relieved and i hope youll stick to it
772,now ill return to that poor woman yonder which he immediately proceeded to do
773,within two minutes he said in loud voice meant for marsac to hear come madame let us look for fontaine in the garden the two walked off round the corner of the terrace in direction opposite to the garden
774,marsac knew in an instant that madame fleurys manuvre meant chance to finish up old duval in private as tigress drags her prey offpg 137 to the jungle to devour
775,marsac then looked carefully around him and seeing that he was quite unobserved he took from his pocket the copy of plato out of which he had been reading to delphine and giving the book vicious kick sent it spinning to the other end of the terrace
776,villain scoundrel dolt rascal idiot were few of the expletives that he hurled after the greatest of the greeks
777,then he walked over to the corner of the terrace where the was as the best point to command view of the grounds and seeing champagne bottle half emptied was about to drink the balance of the wine in order to save it when his eye suddenly fell upon paper lying face upward on the 
778,it was the contract between fontaine and madame fleury
779,marsac could scarcely restrain shout of joy
780,he seized itpg 138 and put it in his pocket but the next moment he saw madame fleury crossing swiftly toward him and alone
781,pardon me she said in voice that she tried unavailingly to make calm
782,i had letter here moment ago in an envelope
783,i put the envelope back in my cardcase and thought i had the letter in it but i have not
784,did you see it on the ground anywhere about here no madame answered marsac looking her steadily in the eye gaze which she as steadily returned
785,madame fleury began eagerly searching on the ground for the letter marsac politely assisting and lighting matches from time to time to supply the fastvanishing light
786,marsac never had so hard task in his life as to keep his countenance straight while he fondled the breastpocket in which lay the document that madame fleury searched for so eagerly
787,madame fleury grew more andpg 139 more anxious as she failed to find the paper
788,they were both tired with stooping and presently sat down on the ground facing each other and each steadily eying the other
789,it is so vexatious to lose letter said madame fleury
790,yes one might lose loveletter hazarded marsac
791,pg 140 not you monsieur marsac replied madame fleury sarcastically
792,true i am not widow was marsacs response to this shot
793,then they both began crawling round again watching each other like cats
794,an idea came into marsacs which almost made him laugh aloud
795,with great show of secrecy he took an old bill of landaiss from his pocket and began to tear it up into little bits which he scattered about
796,madame fleury saw the bits and with as much secrecy as marsac she began to collect them smiling to herself she was convinced that marsac was tearing up the contract
797,presently marsac lighting another match dropped it as if by accident upon little pile of these pieces of paper
798,madame fleury pretended to stumble against him nearly knocking him over and then deftly secured the halfburned scraps
799,they each sat on the ground and surveyed the other with an air of triumph
800,pg 141 never mind about the letter said madame fleury with brilliant smile clutching her precious scraps in her gloved hand and then they both laughed
801,madame fleury rose and shaking her skirts into place said i have not seen monsieur fontaine but i am not illsatisfied with my visit may i have the pleasure of escorting you to your carriage asked marsac
802,no no cried madame fleury hastily i have promised monsieur duval that he shall put me in the carriage a grinding of wheels on the roadway beneath them and behind the tall hedge was now heard and madame fleury flew down the terrace steps as lightly as the swallow skims the ground and then marsac heard vehicle rattle off
803,he could hardly wait until the carriage was halfway down the drive before shouting in his delight for fontaine 142 but fontaine and claire and delphine were all peeping round the verandah and seeing that madame fleury was gone all three came trooping toward marsac
804,my dear fellow cried marsac in tone of suppressed rapture as he took out the contract here is that cursed paper
805,she has gone off with lot of halfburned scraps of an old bill of landaiss which she thinks is this contract fontaine without word hugged marsac according to custom and claire showed such an evident inclination to do the same that marsac gave her truly brotherly embrace to which fontaine made no objection
806,here marsac said tearing the paper is half of it for you fontaine and dear claire the other half is for mademoiselle delphine and me
807,and he added timidly we will have marriage contract between us pg 143 to be destroyed answered delphine supplying what she supposed marsac meant
808,then with laughter and little jokes and blushes on claires part the contract was destroyed
809,never were fourpg 144 persons merrier until claire suddenly asked where is papa at that moment marsac happened to glance toward the highroad that crossed hill about mile off
810,the sunset glow was still upon the hill and marsacs keen eyes recognised monsieur duvals victoria with madame fleury in it and that stout in nankeen trousers and gaiters with the panama hat on his lap could be no other than old duval
811,the situation flashed upon them
812,madame fleury had bamboozled the old man into taking her back to town in one of his own carriages
813,marsac could only point in silent consternation to the carriage
814,the two girls burst into hysterical tears
815,marsac throwing himself into chair groaned aloud while fontaine alone although pretending to be grieved felt perfectly willing to get rid of madame fleury at any price even by presenting her withpg 145 the of his prospective fatherinlaw on chargerafter the manner of herodias another enterprising wouldbe widow of good many years ago
816,pg 146 chapter iv some weeks now passed but not in the happiness which might have been expected when it was at least certain that fontaine and claire could freely love each other
817,old duval had returned late the night he had driven with madame fleury to paris and his conduct since had been such as to make his family miserable
818,under pretence of having some repairs made in the passy villa he had brought them all back to paris in the heats of may and it was tolerably certain that this move was in order to be nearer madame fleury
819,claire was wretched at this idea and although being timid girl she dared not question her father she had every reason to suspect hispg 147 infatuation for the widow who had come so near wrecking fontaines life
820,as for fontaine although he daily and hourly got the benefit of his reputed two millions all the money he made went like wildfire in the effort to keep up the delusion of great fortune
821,he spent his principal and the world thought he was spending his income
822,besides he feared seriously the effect his deception might have upon claire when she found it outwhich she must sometime or other
823,then he began to have morbid apprehension of the real uncle maurice turning up and last and worst of all he was now saddled with reputation for brilliancy founded upon the play the speech and the pictureall marsacs work which had been ably sustained by the series of powerful articles signed by him and written by marsacwhich was simply maddening
824,fontaine who was of an extremely honestpg 148 and simple nature suffered agonies from this false reputation but the embarrassed manner and sickly smile with which he received compliments on his achievements was taken for modesty and he passed therefore as the most modest as well as the most gifted young man in paris
825,as for marsac and delphine they were tormented in hell of their own making
826,each profoundly in love with the other and each smarting under the supposed contempt of the other they grew sharper in their attacks on love and marriage and suffered accordingly
827,one morning marsac happening to go to monsieur duvals quite earlyfor they were now upon the most intimate terms at the househe found fontaine sitting alone in little drawingroom which communicated with the conservatory and overlooked the trees and fountains in the luxembourg gardens
828,the morning papers lay on before him but fontaine sunkpg 149 in deep armchair was picture of misery
829,marsac seeing fontaines gloomy mood began jovially and jauntily i say old man what good time you must have had last night why asked fontaine sulkily
830,because you are so blue this morning you would be blue too in my place answered fontaine sullenly
831,here i am spending every franc i make in the pretence of fortune i havent got and when i tell the truth to claire whom i love from the bottom of my heart she will hate me for the fraud i have practised upon her this view had not occurred so forcibly to marsac before
832,he took turn about the room and then said in an agitated voice is it possible that uncle maurice was not happy invention pg 150 happy invention
833,damn uncle maurice almost shouted fontaine burying his in the pillows of the great chair
834,marsac you are the best fellow in the world but you have been just little too clever this time
835,besides giving me fictitious fortune you have made me out to be the most brilliant man in paris and i can tell you it is simply killing me trying to live up to the character
836,if that picture hadnt been so deuced good if that speech hadnt been so devilish funny if that play hadnt been so damnably brightah hell and all its furies fontaine rolled about his chair in anguish while marsac sat silent and appalled at the result of his own ingenuity
837,and cried fontaine desperately dashing his hand to his forehead suppose that infernal old uncle maurice of mine should turn up from america pg 151 no no said marsac that is impossible
838,no no fate has not such cruel blow in store for us
839,it is just as rational to suppose that the other uncles and aunts i gave you should materialise and come to life in paris a knock at the door startled them both
840,it was an ordinary enough knock such as might precede footman or tradesman but to marsac and fontaine whose nerves had been good deal wrought upon in the last few exciting months it sounded like the crack of doom
841,both of them sat with pale faces and neither could say the ordinary words come in but the person knocking came in after moment
842,he was little old man shabby little old man clutching rusty travellingbag in his trembling hands
843,he stood in the centre of the room looking about awkwardly and timidly 152 marsac felt as if he were frozen to his chair
844,his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and he could feel his hair rising on his 
845,not frankenstein when his monster came to life could have felt more horror
846,fontaine with one wild look seemed inspired with the motion that was denied marsac and darted into the conservatory
847,the old man advanced still holding on to his shabby bag
848,i am told he said hesitatingly that this is the house of monsieur duval and i would find my nephew monsieur auguste fontaine here
849,the lackeys below didnt want to let me up i suppose i am not so well dressed as i ought to be
850,i am augustes uncle just from america
851,i am monsieur maurice fontaine had the archfiend appeared in person with tail and hoofs and horns and said calmly i am beelzebub prince of darkness just from hades he could not have disconcerted marsacpg 153 more
852,he rose to his feet but found himself incapable of speech
853,this then was uncle maurice
854,like the foolish man who let the genie out of the trunk the apparition had grown and grown until it was now unmanageable
855,and here was the substance the actual man of that figment of marsacs imagination here was uncle maurice
856,marsac felt singular kind of acquaintanceship and even kinship with uncle maurice and through it all he had dim sensation of pity for the poor old man standing there holding on apparently to all his few worldly possessions and looking so deprecating so apologetic so blankly disappointed
857,uncle maurice began to speak again trying to smile but his eyes meanwhile filling with tears
858,perhaps i counted too much on this homecoming andandits ridiculous you know for poor old man to expect very warm welcome
859,i havent had pg 154 single hand held out to me yet since i landed a wave of pity swept over marsac
860,terrible as this dnouement was wreck and havoc as it made the old mans disappointment touched him and marsac had one of the best hearts in the world
861,my dear monsieur fontaine he said advancing and trying to speak in natural voice you shall not say that again
862,here is my hand and i guarantee that fontaine who is my best friend my brother in fact will not fail to welcome you
863,i have often heard him speak of you and in the kindest terms did he asked the old man delightedly grasping marsacs hand
864,that was good of the boy
865,i dare say he heard that false report that i was dead he did answered marsac and he put on mourning for you and did not go into society for several weeks pg 155 that seemed to overjoy the poor old man
866,good lad good fellow
867,ill not forget that
868,theres no such proof of real respect
869,and youwhat is your name may i ask marsacand at your service well monsieur marsac since you are so kind tell me more about my nephew
870,you know he is my only near living relative he is noble fellow and he is engaged to be married to the daughter of the owner of this house lovely girl mademoiselle claire duval the old man seated himself and with his precious bag between his knees drank in eagerly marsacs every word
871,marsac saw the advisability of preparing monsieur maurice fontaine for the state of affairs that he must presently find out
872,when fontaine went in mourning for youwhich i am glad to see there was no occasion for and i am glad too
873,go on pg 156 some miscreant started the report that you had left him fortune
874,it got into the newspapers and everybody believed iteven claire
875,fontainefoolishly i thinkdid not confide to her frankly how it was and he was telling me just now his distress at having to confess his deception to claire
876,she is sweet girl though and i believe his confession will not alter her affection in the least
877,i will go and fetch fontaine marsac went into the conservatory
878,there stood fontaine as white as sheet and wildeyed
879,come in and see your uncle whispered marsac
880,i canti wont answered fontaine desperately
881,but you must
882,the best and only thing now is to face the music
883,and besides you would feel sympathy for the old manhe is so humble so gentle and seems so grateful for even the small kindness i have shown him pg 157 he has wrecked my life was fontaines angry reply
884,rubbish
885,you are twenty times better off for him
886,come along and fontaine never having resisted marsac in his life could not do so now and went obediently into the drawingroom to greet affectionately the man whose very existence he conceived was utterly disastrous to him
887,uncle maurice was charmed with the reception he got from fontaine and immediately began joking him about claire
888,and she thought you had rich old uncle who had died and left you fortuneha
889,ha he chuckled
890,well perhaps after all you will be just as happy when the truth is known fontaine could scarcely stand this but luckily uncle maurice concluded he would make himself little presentable before being introduced to claire
891,i have some better clothes than these he said apologetically thoughpg 158 i havent them in my bag with me never mind said marsac cordially go to our quarters just around the corner here are my keys
892,get anything you wantlinen cigars liqueursand come back very soon so we can present you to claire and her cousin delphine
893,we will wait for you here let me assist you said fontaine trying to take the old bag
894,no no no cried uncle maurice determinedly ive got to hold on to thatit has all my little savings in it and the old man went off promising to return in half an hour
895,left alone marsac and fontaine avoided each others gaze and said not word
896,language could not express the depth the height the breadth of the catastrophe that had befallen them
897,yet they were undeniably better off than if uncle maurice had never lived 159 after long and painful pause marsac spoke
898,you must confess at once to claire and i dont believe it will change her affection for you fontaine had no time to reply for at that moment claire and delphine entered the room together
899,it was plain that they were distressed aboutpg 160 something and delphines first words were we are in very great trouble all is not bright for us either gloomily replied marsac
900,ours is very real trouble began claire half crying
901,we have found out that papa spends half his time with madame fleury
902,he writes to her and today came bill for thirty bouquets in three weeks for her
903,if he should marry heroh the thought is too dreadful and claire burst into tears
904,fontaine took her hand tenderly and led her into the conservatory
905,marsac and delphine were now left alone
906,marsac for once was completely unnerved but he managed to hide it from delphine
907,what do you suppose auguste and claire find to say to each other in these tremendously long private interviews she asked wishing from the bottom of her heart that marsac would showpg 161 some inclination toward long private interviews with her
908,i have great mind to interrupt this one pray dont cried marsac eagerly and then with sickly attempt at return to his old manner he said let them be happy while they can
909,soon they will be married and then a dismal shaking of the finished the sentence
910,every word went like knife to delphines tortured heart but not to be outdone she flippantly replied as far as those two go plato might never have lived and socrates might never have died now for long time ever since marsac had known and loved delphine the name of plato had become peculiarly odious to him
911,he considered that large part of the misery he was enduring was directly to be laid at the door of that philosopher and he hadpg 162 often ardently wished to himself that plato and not socrates had been forced to drink the hemlock
912,he could not forbear saying bitterly do you know mademoiselle there are persons who loathe and hate and despise and revile and scorn and contemn the plato marsacs tone of ineffable disgust when he said   might have enlightened delphine but it did not
913,i am afraid our two friends in the conservatory do not appreciate him she answered smiling
914,i dare say claire is asking auguste the very same question that eve asked adam in the garden of edenis she the only woman he has ever loved it occurred to marsac that it would be well to prepare delphine for what fontaine actually was revealing at that moment so drawing his chair nearer he said confidentially mademoiselle i can tell you exactly what they are talking about at this moment 163 what would you think if i were to tell you that fontaines uncle maurice was not dead after all but has just arrived at our lodgings and will very soon present himself in this room delphines mouth came open with astonishment and her first question when she had recovered from the shock of her surprise was and how about the fortune marsac shook his lugubriously
915,i can tell you nothing
916,that fortune is involved in the deepest mystery
917,there are indications of plot the most extraordinary you can conceive
918,i know nothing except that monsieur maurice fontaine is alive and is in paris and will be here shortly and then to her from so perilous subject he said but we are consumed with anxiety regarding monsieur duval and the comtesse de fleury
919,it will be terrible for you and claire if she succeeds in capturing monsieur duval pg 164 delphines answer was artfully contrived if that dreadful woman should succeed in marrying my uncle this could no longer be home for me here was an opportunity at once for marsac to declare himself if he had spark of tenderness for her
920,the tenderness amounting to adoration was there but marsacthe ready the witty the glib the daringwas silent and abashed in the presence of the masterpassion
921,his silence which was really one of deep emotion was naturally misunderstood by delphine
922,just as he had nerved himself to take what he thought desperate chance by telling her of his love her face hardened she deliberately turned her back to him and picking up some fancywork on the seated herself at it
923,there was nothing left for marsac but the newspaper which fontaine had dropped
924,he took it and for half anpg 165 hour no sound was heard except the rattle of the sheets as they were turned
925,delphine stitched in silent anger and disappointment
926,it seemed fated that all the persons whom marsac and fontaine particularly did not wish to see at m
927,duvals house should turn up that morning for within five minutes of marsacs and delphines latest misunderstanding footman appeared to announce another startling arrival
928,the man usually maintained the stolid countenance of his tribe but on this occasion he wore grin like rattrap
929,msieu marsac he said almost laughing in marsacs gloomy face heres person a lady if you please proclaimed loud voice as madame schmid marched in shoving the footman unceremoniously out of the way
930,poor marsacs nerves were sufficiently unstrung by uncle maurices arrival and madame schmids seemedpg 166 likely to finish him
931,but she was such goodhearted creature and in spite of having figuratively dragged fontaine and himself around by the hair of their heads had washed and scrubbed for them so faithfully that marsac could not find it in his heart to receive her coldly
932,as for madame schmid marsacs delightful impudence had won its way into her honest heart and she had come to do him great service
933,her errand not being professional one she wore gorgeous red bonnet all flowers green mantle all spangles purple gown all stripes and with yellow parasol looked something like bird of paradise
934,here you are she cried broad smile on her handsome face
935,just as impudent as ever i warrant
936,if i get out of this room without being kissed delphine looking on in amazement became pale at this while marsac turned blue in the face
937,pg 167 i perceive i am in the way murmured delphine in scarcely audible voice and made for the door
938,mademoisellei implore marsac got this far when delphine slammed the door in his face
939,is the young lady jealous asked madame schmid delightedly
940,i am afraid not was marsacs dejected reply
941,well msieu began madame schmid with an air of importance i have come to tell you and that pretty boy fontaine something you will like to hear
942,in the first place madame fleury is coming here this morning charming
943,ha
944,ha
945,fontaine will be rapturously happy wait minute
946,dont laugh in that dismal manner
947,she is determined of course to marry m
948,duval but she thinks by coming to this house she can force fontaine to give her money rather than betray her presence to his fiance
949,well i found this outnopg 168 matter howand i said this morning to fleury to fleury to fleury
950,he is no more dead than you or i
951,he has been living at my house for month past
952,i said i wont keep your secret any longer
953,ill tell your wife that you are alive oh he cried like baby at that marsac seized her hands and could only cry breathlessly go on
954,go on it was this way
955,about month ago fleury came walking into my place and asked for lodgings
956,i said why you were drowned he said i wasnt i said your wife thinks so he said i hope she will keep on thinking so i hadnt the heart to betray the poor creature so i said nothing until i heard about this new move of his wifes but then i determined to tell you and i have him around the corner in wineshop where he is crying and drinking and you must come with me pg 169 two minutes later delphine saw from an upper window madame schmid parading down the street with marsac gallantly holding the yellow parasol over her red bonnet and attending her as if she were duchess
957,that then was the woman marsac loved
958,delphine pale and agonised returned to the drawingroom
959,there came rustle of draperies from the conservatory and claire flitted in with fontaine
960,one look at their happy faces told that uncle maurices fortune had made no in their love affair
961,what do you think delphine asked claire with her hand still lying in fontainesthis foolish boy has not fortune after all and he has known it for some time and dared not tell me
962,it seems that when the report of his uncle maurices death came some one started the story in the newspapers about the fortune andpg 170 auguste did not have the nerve to contradict it
963,besides it might have been true for he had an uncle maurice in america
964,and this very morning uncle maurice arrived in paris and was directed here to find auguste
965,and auguste says the old man looks very poor and friendless but cheery and glad to get back to france and dear kind monsieur marsac was so good to the old man and made auguste kind to him too
966,so he has gone to their apartment to make ready to come and see us
967,i shall be just as nice to him as i can be and i shall make papa be the same claire you have the dearest heart in the world burst out delphine generously forgetting her own misery and i love and respect you the more for not caring whether auguste has fortune or not but with his talents answered claire proudly  fortune will be his
968,we can live well enough on his picturespg 171 his plays and his articles in the newspapers fontaines effort at cheerful grin when this was said was piteous to behold
969,just then the footman again entered and handed him card
970,one look was enough
971,it is madame fleury he cried
972,dont let her up but he was too late
973,madame fleury walked into the drawingroom on the heels of her messenger and said to the servant in an authoritative manner take my card to monsieur duval never had the gentle claire showed haughtiness to any human creature before but when face to face with madame fleury she drew her slight up and in tone of quiet disdain said i think madame that imy fathers daughterhave some rights in this house and i forbid my servant to take your card and i think suavely repliedpg 172 madame fleury that your father master of his house has some rights here too so a look at the footman finished the sentence
974,the man went out with the card
975,claire with heightened colour turned to delphine saying shall we withdraw by no means answered delphine coolly that would indeed be surrender they both therefore stood their ground
976,fontaine who was glad to keep out of the mle had prudently kept in the background during this but madame fleury would not let him rest there
977,monsieur fontaine she asked in her smoothest voice do you remember certain document which we both signed referring to the 15th of may i do to my eternal sorrow was fontaines reply but before he could say anything more monsieur duval bustled in looking flurried nervouspg 173 but elated with the elation of stupid old man who finds himself an object of interest to handsome young woman
978,good morning madame he cried
979,i am delighted to see you it is more than your daughter and niece were answered madame fleury smiling
980,how is this sternly asked monsieur duval wheeling around upon the two girls
981,claire who dearly loved her father could not utter word but delphine was equal to the situation
982,of course we were not delighted to see her and unclepardon mebut man of your age should know better monsieur duval interrupted madame fleury your age is one of your greatest charms in my eyes and yet coolly continued delphine monsieur fontaines youth was no objection to him
983,anything between the cradle and the grave seems to suit thisperson pg 174 monsieur duval felt called upon to say reprovingly delphine but the next moment he weakened and muttered i wish marsac were here
984,he is the only one that can manage all of you i wish he were too said madame fleury
985,i was just speaking of valuable paper i took with me to passy that evening i was there
986,by an unfortunate oversight on my part monsieur marsac got hold of it and tore it into bits which he afterward tried to burn up
987,i saved the scraps but i was not able to put the charred pieces together
988,therefore i gave an expert one hundred and fifty francs to restore it
989,he has just returned it to me and i have not yet had chance to open it but i will do it now and i would like monsieur marsac to see how much cleverer i am than he is madame fleury produced an envelope from her cardcase tore it open and then stood petrified for moment 175 whyit isit is she stammered
990,a bill of landais the tailor maliciously put in fontaine
991,that is what he tore up and what you paid one hundred and fifty francs to have restored delphine chimed in
992,madame fleury said fontaine determinedly i have put up with this hounding of me as long as i intend to 176 i shall today report it to the police and ask protection instead of flying into rage at this madame fleury executed masterly coup
993,pressing her handkerchief to her eyes she almost fell upon old duvals shoulder crying monsieur duval will you stand by and see me so affronted no madame fleury sturdily answered monsieur duval with his arm half round her waist
994,never mind madame fleury
995,if he reports you to the police madame fleury he will have to reckon with me madame fleury
996,i know im old enough to be your father but if youll marry me madame fleury youll find me great improvement on that rascally count you married first and you may be madame duval any day you like at this faint shriek burst from the two girls and fontaine who had not dreamed the old man capable of such folly couldnt repress an exclamation 177 however he took claires hand and said to her tenderly well my dear one the only thing for you to do now is to trust me and become my wife at the earliest moment possible claire felt at that moment as if she had but one earthly dependence she clung to fontaine and weeping said i will marry you whenever you like for i cannot and never will countenance my fathers marriage to this creature and even i would marry to escape living with this woman said delphine in much agitation
997,i would marry monsieur marsac or commit suicide even rather than live in the house with her delphine was scarcely conscious of what she said but gleam of wicked amusement in madame fleurys eyes showed her that she had made dangerous slip
998,pg 178 steps were heard outside in the hall as if of three or even four persons but when the door opened only marsac entered
999,he wore look of jaunty expectation which seemed only to be increased by the startling spectacle before himmadame fleury holding on to monsieur duvals arm the old man puffing blowing smiling and frowning with alternate spasms of rage and delight claire clinging to fontaine and in great distress while delphine pale and defiant stood alone in the centre of the group
1000,it was one of the most delicious moments of madame fleurys life
1001,when marsac raising his eyebrows inquired what is this i see madame fleury cut in before even monsieur duval could reply you see the betrothal between monsieur duval and me marsacs wide handsome mouth came open as if it were on hinges
1002,his enjoyment of the situation seemedpg 179 intense and fontaine claire and delphine were all astounded at his heartless amusement over catastrophe so ruinous to all of them
1003,he only said with grin after surveying the scene for minute or two and are you quite certain madame of carrying out your plan perfectly certain responded monsieur duval pompously and she will find her good old duval better husband than that rascally count she married first and buried afterward but did she bury him asked marsac and paused to get the whole effect of this
1004,it was magical on madame fleury
1005,she clenched her teeth her eyes flashed fire but she held on stoutly to monsieur duval who grew white about the chops
1006,marsac after coolly surveying his audience announced i have the honour of presenting to you madame fleurys husband with that he threw the door openpg 180 with grand flourish and in walked one of the most weazened cadaverous little men who ever stepped and behind him madame schmids rubicund countenance and rotund 
1007,madame fleury could not repress cry of rage and monsieur duval dropped her arm as if it was redhot
1008,fleury who seemed not at all abashed by his surroundings looked calmly about
1009,monsieur duval was the first to recover his voice and his disgusted exclamation was that creature count i did not say he was count corrected marsac
1010,i merely said by way of making things agreeable that madame fleury was countess madame fleurys reply to this was one word uttered in tone of concentrated hatred wretch is that all the thanks i get for restoring to you your longlost husbandpg 181 said marsac in an injured voice
1011,oh the ingratitude that is in this world fleury meanwhile seemed determined to assert himself
1012,im not count he said and that lady yonder indicating madame fleury always turned up her nose at me but i am not as insignificant as she would have you believe
1013,i have standing offer from the medical school of seventyfive francs for my skeleton as soon as i peg out i wish it were available at this moment cried madame fleury
1014,there said fleury i knew she wouldnt be glad to see me and i told this gentleman so
1015,but i dont know that i am very glad to see her
1016,i havent had so peaceable and quiet time since i was married as when i was dead here madame schmid was bound to be heard i said to fleury said i hold said old duval advancingpg 182 i know this person
1017,it is the baroness schmid baroness schmid
1018,comte de fleury
1019,oh this is too comical screamed madame schmid laughing
1020,who wanted to marry monsieur fontaine continued old duval determinedly
1021,no no cried delphine almost beside herself with jealousy
1022,she wants to marry monsieur marsac i want to marry that pretty boy fontaine bawled madame schmid finding her voice
1023,i want to marry msieu marsac
1024,i want their washing thats all
1025,im washerwoman ladies and gentlemen implored marsac all can be explained at future day but the fact remains that this is monsieur fleury old duvals face was study during this and he began to stammer iidont think we can be married madame the hopelessness of her situationpg 183 was plain to madame fleury
1026,she prepared to depart from the house she had intended to preside over
1027,she gave glance of speechless contempt around the circle including every member of it and ending at fontaine who had taken no part in the dnouement but had watched it in amazed but delighted silence
1028,monsieur duval she said in hard voice i am truly sorry i cannot marry you
1029,as for monsieur fontaine i would only have married him for lack of something better
1030,the indignation of the two young ladies against me seemed wholly devised to marry themselves off
1031,mademoiselle claire at once announced her willingness to marry monsieur fontaine while mademoiselle delphine took occasion to say that she would marry monsieur marsac or commit suicideeach terrible alternative
1032,for monsieur marsac i can say that he has concocted and conducted the most extraordinarypg 184 fraud ever perpetrated upon you
1033,i am firmly convinced there never was an uncle maurice and the story of his death and his fortune was pure invention of marsacs from beginning to end the story of his death i grant you i was mistaken about blandly responded marsac but as to there being an uncle maurice marsac stepped to the door opened it and uncle maurice evidently bubbling over with delight entered still holding on to the seedy old bag
1034,allow me said marsac with low bow to present to you all ladies and gentlemen monsieur maurice fontaine late of new york and from henceforth from paris madame fleury seemed literally stunned by the sight of the little old man who without noticing the sensation made by his appearance went all round the circle shaking hands not forgetting madame fleury who gavepg 185 him her hand like woman in nightmare and then he asked where is my little niece claire ran up to him looked smilingly into his face and said here i am uncle maurice the old mans gratification was touching
1035,he kissed her cheek he patted her hair and stroked her hand again and again but he never let go of his bag
1036,monsieur duval gazed mechanically at uncle maurice while delphines cordiality was second only to claires
1037,ah cried uncle maurice beginning and shaking hands all round for the second time you cant imagine how kindly i was received by these two fine fellows
1038,they didnt mind my shabby clothes they treated me nobly
1039,i shant forget it my lads madame fleury at this found her tongue
1040,he doesnt look as if his acquaintance would be much of anpg 186 acquisition to his family she said scornfully
1041,eh asked uncle maurice and he seemed stung by her remark
1042,well he continued with an unexpected twinkle in his eyes thats as may be
1043,i have in this bag million francs worth of united states government bonds part of what i made in that noble country
1044,i intended some of it for my nephew provided he received me kindly
1045,i am proud and happy to say he did so when he thought i hadnt decent coat to my back so ill give himlet me seei might as well do the thing handsomelyhalf million francs so he can get married he opened the bag and took out parcel
1046,monsieur duval you are man of affairs you know what these are the sight of the securities seemed to wake monsieur duval up
1047,he examined the parcel carefully while fontaine brokenly expressed his thankspg 187 and claire kissed the old man with tears in her eyes
1048,and auguste she cried generously monsieur marsac must share in our good fortune you know he has shared everything with you indeed he shall replied fontaine clasping marsacs hand
1049,perhaps you dont know said madame fleury to uncle maurice stopping in somewhat precipitate flight toward the door that it was that marsac who started the story of your giving fontaine fortune did you thenha
1050,ha uncle maurice seemed tickled at the idea
1051,yes replied marsac modestly when it was reported that you were dead i determined to give fontaine every franc of your fortune and i gave you sir very good character besides
1052,i endowed you with every virtue of man and gentleman and it seems i was clairvoyant uncle maurice laughed excessivelypg 188 at this and handing smaller roll out of the old bag to marsac he said well i would like to have you for nephew too for you were no less kind than my nephew and with less obligation so there is hundred thousand francs for you mere nestegg
1053,a fellow as clever as you can always make his way in the world marsac was overwhelmed by the old mans generosity and the silence as he stood grasping uncle maurices hand was only broken by the slamming of the door as madame fleury rushed out dragging the unhappy fleury after her
1054,as monsieur duval watched her exit he said slowly perhaps it is better after all that i am not in fleurys shoes a great deal better remarked uncle maurice solemnly shes too much for you monsieur duval this great truth seemed to strikepg 189 the old brewer with much force the more so when madame schmid said pointing after fleurys departing  that man weighed near two hundred pounds when he married that woman and i believe he has lost not less than pound day since that time and you see what he is now
1055,well i must be going
1056,msieu marsac when you and that pretty young ladypointing to delphineare married please to give me your washing
1057,the same to you msieu fontaine and your young lady marsac was so embarrassed by this speech that he remained perfectly silent but fontaine escorted madame schmid to the door with profuse thanks
1058,old duval still seemed dazed about the dead and the living uncle maurice
1059,at every mention of the suppositious uncle maurice the real one would shake with merriment
1060,so monsieur marsac made up the yarn said monsieur duval dubiously
1061,pg 190 the noble romance you mean replied marsac
1062,my invention of uncle maurice ranks with orestes with pantagruel with don quixote with all those splendid creations of the imagination that are as real to us as you sir are to uncle maurice
1063,i endowed you with every virtue and i find happily that i have only done you justice marsac folded his arms and assumed look of triumphant virtue
1064,what clever fellow
1065,what very clever fellow chuckled uncle maurice delightedly
1066,and i also invented two other rich uncles and an aged and decrepit auntall of whom were to make fontaine their heir added marsac at which uncle maurice nearly went into convulsions of enjoyment
1067,i used to think said monsieur duval that monsieur marsac with his plays and his paintpots and hispg 191 writing and his fiddling was great fool but i have changed my opinion a thousand thanks replied marsac with dignitynot only for myself but for all the other fools who write or paint or fiddle and thereby add to the gaiety of nations well well well said monsieur duval hastily let us sit down and talk things over so he and uncle maurice and fontaine and claire formed group and sat down
1068,delphine who had taken but little part in the proceedings but whose heart had swelled at marsacs triumph walked toward the embrasure of window
1069,marsac followed her
1070,the curtain fell behind them and they were as much alone as if in another room
1071,outside the window the fountains plashed in the may air the day was all blue and gold
1072,the trees in the luxembourg gardens rustled softly it was day for making love
1073,presently marsac spoke timidlypg 192 mademoiselle i recall some words of that shedevil madame fleury
1074,she said you had declared you would commit suicide orormarry me iftell me what did you mean just what i said answered delphine with beautiful blush
1075,did you mean that either fate was equally dreadful no or perhaps thati have second thought but i am afraid to mention it second thoughts are always best demurely replied delphine
1076,and then there was scene that would have broken the heart of platonist
1077,a few murmured words handclaspand delphine lay in marsacs arms
1078,a bird was singing in tree outside the window and bird also sang in their two happy hearts
1079,so deep was their ecstasy that they did not hear steps approach nor the curtain softly drawn and they werepg 193 wakened from their dream in paradise by shout of laughter
1080,fontaine and claire uncle maurice and monsieur duval were laughing uproariously and gazing at the two apostles of platonic love the relentless enemies of matrimonymarsac with his arm round delphines waist and his handsome almost touching her bright hair
1081,old duval grunted out one word plato let plato go to the devil cried marsac
1082,if ever i meet the old scoundrel on the other side of the styx i promise to kick him all over the lower regions for having deprived me for one hour of the sweet knowledge of delphines love hurrah cried uncle maurice
1083,to perdition with the rascal plato he is there already i hope shouted fontaine dancing in his delight
1084,hurrah
1085,hurrah
1086,hurrah
